# On-demand: pulls in updates from the original mystic-auth template repo.
# Nothing here runs automatically. See
# docs/mystic_auth/template-usage/syncing-upstream/README.md for what conflicts and
# what almost never will.
#
# Two sync strategies, chosen automatically:
#
#   1. First sync ever (no .mystic-auth-sync-state file yet): a whole-tree
#      `git merge --squash --allow-unrelated-histories`, so upstream's own
#      commits never become ancestors of your history.
#   2. Every sync after: an incremental `git diff <last-synced-sha>
#      upstream/branch | git apply --3way`. Squash has no merge-base on
#      unrelated histories so it re-diffs the whole tree every time; the
#      incremental diff has a real baseline, so an untouched file produces
#      zero diff instead of a phantom conflict. `--3way` turns an unclean
#      hunk into a real 3-way merge with conflict markers instead of
#      hard-failing the patch.
#
# Three safety nets run after either strategy, before anything commits:
#   - A "did anything actually change" check: `git apply`/`git merge` can
#     report success while one file (a binary file is the sharpest example)
#     silently fails to apply. Compares the file list the diff says should
#     have changed against what's actually staged/conflicted, and refuses to
#     commit on a mismatch.
#   - An executable-bit self-heal for scripts/**/*.sh (see the comment at
#     that check below for why this runs every sync, not just once).
#   - scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/check-alembic-heads.sh: catches this app and
#     upstream both adding a migration on the same fork point, which
#     otherwise stays silent until `alembic upgrade head` fails at deploy time.
#
# Also enables `git rerere`: once a conflict is resolved by hand, git
# reapplies that resolution if the same-shaped conflict recurs, which happens
# often when upstream rewords a comment next to your own edit.
#
# Usage: scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/sync-upstream.sh [upstream-url]
#   upstream-url defaults to the original template repo; pass your own fork's
#   URL if you're syncing from somewhere else.
