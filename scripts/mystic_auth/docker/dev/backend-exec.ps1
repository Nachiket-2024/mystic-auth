# --user root is here. It fixes native Linux coverage-output ownership and is
# a no-op on Windows/Docker Desktop. PowerShell and Command Prompt were never
# affected by the Git-Bash-only `-w /repo` path-rewriting bug. See
# docs/mystic_auth/docker/dev-workflow.md#running-a-one-off-command-inside-a-container),

# -w /repo is needed for pytest (pytest.ini's testpaths/--cov paths are
# relative to the repo root), but alembic.ini lives at /repo/backend, not
# /repo, so a bare `alembic heads` from -w /repo fails with "No
# 'script_location' key found in configuration" despite being this
# script's own documented example above. ALEMBIC_CONFIG points alembic at
# the right file regardless of cwd, without changing -w for every other
# command.
