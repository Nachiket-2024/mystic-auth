#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Rotates SECRET_KEY and/or BUGSINK_SECRET_KEY in place in one or more real
# env/mystic_auth/.env* files, generating a fresh random value for each.
# Also rotates any of your own env/app/ secret fields declared in
# scripts/app/env-tools/rotate-secrets/fields.env - see that file's own
# header. Ships empty, so by default this script only ever touches the two
# mystic_auth fields below.
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow: these two fields are the only secrets safe
# to rotate by just editing the file and restarting. Every other secret
# field (POSTGRES_PASSWORD, APP_DB_PASSWORD, BUGSINK_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD,
# REDIS_PASSWORD) is backed by state a live service already has: Postgres
# only applies POSTGRES_PASSWORD on first volume init, so editing the file
# after that does nothing to the role's real password and just breaks
# DATABASE_URL; Bugsink's admin password lives in its own database, not
# this file. Rotating those safely means changing them at the live service
# (ALTER ROLE, Bugsink's own admin tools) first, not something this script
# attempts. The same reasoning applies to whatever you list in
# fields.env - only list a field there if editing the file and restarting
# is genuinely enough to rotate it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/rotate-secrets/rotate-secrets.sh [--field NAME] [file ...]
#
# With no file arguments, rotates every env/mystic_auth/.env* file, plus
# every env/app/.env* file if fields.env declares at least one field.
# With no --field, rotates every applicable field wherever present in a
# given file.
