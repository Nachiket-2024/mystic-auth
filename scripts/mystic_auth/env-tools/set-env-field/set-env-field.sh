#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Sets one or more fields across every real env file that already declares
# each key, leaving every other field untouched. For a value that's the
# same everywhere on purpose (SUPPORT_EMAIL, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
# DEFAULT_APP_POLICIES, ...), instead of opening and editing five files by
# hand, one field at a time.
#
# Two ways to use it:
#
#   From a file (no arguments, easiest): copy shared-values.env.example
#   (next to this script) to shared-values.env, fill in whichever fields
#   you want set everywhere with a normal text editor, then run:
#
#     scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/set-env-field/set-env-field.sh
#
#   For a field you added yourself (one only env/app/ declares), use the
#   parallel scripts/app/env-tools/set-env-field/shared-values.env.example
#   instead - same copy/fill/run steps, ships empty, upstream never edits
#   it. Both files are read in this mode; the app one wins on overlap.
#
#   Nothing here ever puts a value on the command line or asks you to
#   type it into a chat with an AI agent - shared-values.env is gitignored
#   and only this script's own output (field names, never values) needs to
#   be shared with anyone.
#
#   Direct (one-line, scriptable - what docs/agent prompts use):
#
#     scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/set-env-field/set-env-field.sh KEY1=VALUE1 [KEY2=VALUE2 ...] [file ...]
#
#   Any argument containing "=" is a field assignment (only the first "="
#   splits key from value, so a value can itself contain "="). Any
#   argument without "=" is a target file - so file arguments can appear
#   anywhere, not just at the end.
#
# With no file arguments (either form), targets every env/mystic_auth/.env*
# and env/app/.env* file plus frontend/.env that actually exists. A file
# missing a given KEY= line is
# skipped for that field, not created or appended to - this only ever
# changes a value that's already there.
#
# Uses awk instead of sed so a value is never interpreted as a regex or a
# sed replacement pattern: slashes, ampersands, etc. in a URL or email
# address are safe to pass as-is.
