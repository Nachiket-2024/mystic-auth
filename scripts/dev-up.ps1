# Deliberately NOT $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop": docker compose (build
# progress, pull progress, etc.) routinely writes routine, non-error output
# to stderr. PowerShell 5.1 wraps every stderr line from a native command
# into a terminating ErrorRecord when ErrorActionPreference is "Stop", which
# killed this script immediately after the first `docker compose up -d`
# line, before it ever reached the final `docker compose logs -f` tail :
# so the taskiq_worker startup lines (and everything else) never appeared.
# Native command failures are instead caught explicitly via $LASTEXITCODE
# checks below, same as the existing check after `docker compose up -d`.
$ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"

# Starts the full stack and waits for every long-running service to report
# healthy, or just running for the frontend dev server, before tailing the
# backend/frontend/taskiq_worker logs.
#
# This mirrors dev-up.sh for PowerShell users. It does not use
# `docker compose up --wait` because alembic and bugsink-seed are one-shot
# containers that should exit 0 after successful startup work.

# container alone when nothing about it changed, so on a rerun against a
# live stack those banners are from whenever it originally booted : older
# than $TailSince below, so the tail at the bottom would silently skip
# them. Restarting the two here guarantees a fresh banner inside the
# --since window on every run, not just the first.
