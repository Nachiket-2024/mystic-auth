# PowerShell/cmd entry point for sync-upstream.sh.
#
# This does NOT reimplement sync-upstream.sh's logic natively. That script is
# dense git plumbing (incremental 3-way apply, a silent-partial-apply guard,
# an executable-bit self-heal, static alembic-head parsing) with its own
# 346-line regression suite (test-sync-upstream.sh) built specifically
# because this class of script is easy to get subtly wrong. A second,
# independently-written implementation would mean two copies of that logic to
# keep in sync forever, with no shared test coverage between them - the
# wrong tradeoff for a script whose entire job is safety nets.
#
# Instead, this locates the Git Bash that already ships with Git for Windows
# (the same `git` install this script needs regardless of shell) and runs
# the real, already-tested sync-upstream.sh through it. One command, no
# manual "open Git Bash first" step, and zero duplicated logic.
#
# Usage: .\scripts\upstream-sync\sync-upstream.ps1 [upstream-url]
