# running database needed, so this works from a bare git checkout.
#
# Two heads happen when the template and a downstream app each add a
# migration on the same fork point: both point their down_revision at the
# same old revision, so neither is anyone else's parent. `alembic upgrade
# head` doesn't catch this ahead of time -- it fails at deploy/migrate time
# with "Multiple head revisions are present". This catches it right after a
# sync instead.

# Usage: scripts/upstream-sync/check-alembic-heads.sh
# Exit 0: single head (or no migrations yet). Exit 1: 2+ heads, details printed.

This usually means the template and this app each added a migration on top
of the same fork point -- two chains now claim to be the latest, and
"alembic upgrade head" will refuse to run ("Multiple head revisions are
present") until this is resolved.

Fix it with a merge migration (needs a real alembic install, e.g. inside the
backend container):

  docker compose exec backend alembic merge heads -m "merge migration branches"

That generates one new file whose down_revision is both heads above -- commit
it like any other migration. See docs/mystic_auth/template-usage/syncing-upstream.md
for when this runs and why.
