# Starts the full stack, waits for long-running services, and prints a
# one-line-per-service status table before tailing focused logs.
#
# Avoids `docker compose up --wait` because alembic and bugsink-seed are
# one-shot containers that should exit 0 after startup work. This polls only
# the long-running services.
#
# On success, tails only backend, frontend, and taskiq_worker logs. That keeps
# request traffic, Vite output, and async email jobs visible without Postgres,
# Redis, Alembic, or Bugsink health-check noise. Backend exceptions still go to
# Bugsink at http://localhost:8010.
#
# backend and taskiq_worker are restarted after `up -d` so their startup
# banners are fresh even when the stack was already running.
#
# This is the recommended day-to-day command. See README.md. Use plain
# `docker compose up` instead when you actually want every service's full
# logs in one stream (e.g. debugging Postgres/Bugsink/Taskiq startup itself).
