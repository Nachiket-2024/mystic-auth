#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Starts the full stack and waits for every long-running service to
# actually report healthy (or just running, for the one service with no
# healthcheck) before showing anything else : so a real startup failure is
# a clean one-line-per-service table, not a scroll of interleaved logs to
# spot it in.
#
# Deliberately does NOT use `docker compose up --wait`: this repo's compose
# file includes one-shot init containers (alembic, bugsink-seed) that are
# *supposed* to exit 0 once their job is done, but `--wait` treats any
# exited container as a failure to reach "running", regardless of exit
# code : it would report this stack as failed on every single successful
# start. This polls the actual long-running services directly instead.
#
# On success, tails only backend + frontend + taskiq_worker: real request
# traffic, the frontend dev server's own activity, and async email-task
# execution. It still excludes Postgres/Redis/Bugsink/Alembic internals and
# Bugsink's own health-check polling noise. Backend exceptions still go to
# Bugsink (http://localhost:8010), that's what it's for, not this terminal.
# backend and taskiq_worker are also explicitly `restart`ed after `up -d` so
# their boot banner (Uvicorn's startup lines, Taskiq's "Listening started")
# is always visible in that tail, even when this script is rerun against a
# stack that was already up and neither container needed recreating.
#
# This is the recommended day-to-day command : see README.md. Use plain
# `docker compose up` instead when you actually want every service's full
# logs in one stream (e.g. debugging Postgres/Bugsink/Taskiq startup itself).
#
# Usage: ./scripts/dev-up.sh   (Git Bash or WSL on Windows)
# PowerShell: .\scripts\dev-up.ps1

# --quiet-pull: without it, Compose's pull-progress table repaints itself
# every frame; on terminals that can't redraw in place, each repaint prints
# as a brand-new block of lines instead of overwriting the last one : looks
# like it's stuck re-pulling the same image dozens of times when it's
# really just one pull, redrawn. This silences that table; real pull

# backend/taskiq_worker are the two services whose boot banner (Uvicorn's
# "Application startup complete", Taskiq's "Listening started", etc.) is
# actually useful to see. `docker compose up -d` leaves an already-running
# container alone when nothing about it changed, so on a rerun against a
# live stack those banners are from whenever it originally booted : older
# than $TAIL_SINCE below, so the tail at the bottom would silently skip
# them. Restarting the two here guarantees a fresh banner inside the
# --since window on every run, not just the first.
