/**
 * Registers a response interceptor on the shared `api` instance that, on a 401 from an endpoint
 * eligible for silent refresh, attempts to rotate the session via /auth/refresh/ and retry the
 * original request exactly once. If refresh fails, the endpoint isn't eligible, or this is
 * already a post-refresh retry that 401'd again, marks the Zustand auth store as unauthenticated
 * and invalidates the cached currentUser query — every ProtectedRoute-wrapped page already
 * re-renders reactively off that store and redirects to /login, so no hard `window.location`
 * redirect is needed here.
 *
 * Deliberately 401-only, not 401-or-403: a 403 means the caller IS authenticated but lacks a
 * specific permission — forcing a logout/redirect-to-login on that would be confusing (the
 * session is fine) and would fight with the conditional-rendering/route-guard components
 * (Authorized/IfCan/ProtectedRoute) that are meant to handle "you don't have this permission"
 * without ending the session. Only a 401 means the session itself is no longer valid (or, per
 * this fix, might still be salvageable via one refresh attempt).
 *
 * Lives in its own module (rather than inside axiosInstance.ts itself) specifically to avoid a
 * circular import: axiosInstance.ts -> queryClient.ts -> useCurrentUserQuery.ts -> auth_api.ts ->
 * axiosInstance.ts. Keeping the core/queryClient imports out of axiosInstance.ts breaks that
 * cycle. Call once at app startup (see main.tsx), after `api` exists.
