/** The bg.canvasFrom pair for an arbitrary brand scale - shared with

 * accent" system from design/dashboard.html's approved mockup: that page's
 * body background is a *very* faint radial brand tint (rgba(brand-500,
 * .07) light / .14 dark over an otherwise neutral canvas), not a visibly
 * colored wash. L=95 (up from an earlier L=90/92) is what actually gets
 * there - at very high lightness a color reads as barely-there regardless
 * of its raw saturation number, so this keeps `scale["600"]`'s hue/sat
 * mostly intact (only trimmed to 45%) rather than desaturating it, the
 * mistake an earlier pass made (assuming "muted" meant "less saturated"
 * when it actually meant "much lighter"). Dark value: blends gray.900 with
 * the 900 step at a light 25% weight - enough to keep a hint of brand cast,
 * not enough to read as a colored panel. */

/** The bg.sidebar pair (Sidebar.tsx/Navbar.tsx's own surface, distinct from
 * bg.surface/bg.canvas, and from bg.canvasFrom's gradient tint) for an
 * arbitrary brand scale. Retuned to match design/dashboard.html's approved
 * mockup: its sidebar/navbar "chrome" color (--bg-chrome, #fbf4f2 light /
 * #160f0d dark) sits so close to the page's own canvas color that the two
 * are barely distinguishable - a whisper of brand hue, not a visibly
 * tinted panel. Measuring that mockup color directly: L=96.7/S=53% light,
 * L=6.9/S=26% dark - both nearly the *same lightness as bg.canvas itself*
 * (L=97 light, L=6 dark), unlike an earlier pass here that landed on L=88
 * light / a 0.45-weight dark blend, which read as a distinctly warm/rose
 * panel next to the white cards in front of it (the actual bug the design
 * canvas review flagged: "still using the old rose/tan tinted-everywhere
 * look"). This keeps `scale["600"]`'s saturation mostly intact (a trimmed
 * 85%, since high lightness already mutes it) but pushes lightness up to
 * L=96.5 - just one notch below bg.canvas, enough to read as its own
 * surface without becoming a colored block. Dark mixes BG_CANVAS_DARK (this
 * app's own bg.canvas dark value, not the old Chakra-compatible gray.900 - that
 * floored every blend at L=10, too light to ever reach the mockup's L=6.9
 * no matter the weight) with a deep, near-black step at 60% weight - tuned
 * so the *default* brand color's output lands within a couple RGB values of
 * the mockup's literal #160f0d, while staying a real brand-derived blend
 * for any other brand color a fork picks. */
