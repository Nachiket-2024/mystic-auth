// staleTime plus whatever happens to trigger a refetch (window focus, a
// revoke mutation invalidating it). Logging in on another device doesn't
// invalidate this query at all, so without a poll of its own the list could
// sit showing an old device count well after the "Active sessions" stat
// above it (which does poll) had already moved on - the two visibly
// disagreeing until something else happened to refresh this one.
//
// This is a fallback, not the primary mechanism - useSessionEventsStream.ts
// (SSE) invalidates this query in real time whenever a session actually
// changes, so this poll only needs to cover the rare case that connection
// silently drops.
