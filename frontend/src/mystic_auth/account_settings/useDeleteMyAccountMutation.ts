/**
 * useDeleteMyAccountMutation
 * ----------------------------
 * DELETE /users/me. For a password-holding account this soft-deletes the
 * caller's own account immediately (revoked sessions, recoverable by an
 * admin for ACCOUNT_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS, then permanently purged - see
 * DeleteAccountCard.tsx's copy and docs/mystic_auth/security/decisions.md).
 * The route itself already revokes every session including this one, so on
 * that success path this mirrors useLogoutMutation's cache cleanup exactly:
 * mark unauthenticated immediately rather than waiting on a currentUser
 * refetch that would 401 by design, and drop every "me"-scoped query so
 * nothing stale can flash for whoever uses this browser next.
 *
 * For an OAuth-only account (no password to re-confirm with), the response
 * instead carries `confirmation_required: true`: nothing was deleted yet,
 * only a confirmation email was sent, so this session and its caches stay
 * exactly as they were - DeleteAccountCard.tsx branches on that flag to show
 * "check your email" messaging instead of navigating away.
