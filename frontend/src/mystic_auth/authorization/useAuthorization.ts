 * richer authorize(action, resource_type, resource, context) signature, but
 * NOT used to filter here: GET /auth/me returns a flat list of granted
 * actions with no resource-type dimension of its own. For a check that
 * genuinely depends on resource_type, ownership, or a condition
 * (time/network/...), call the real backend endpoint
 * (POST /authorization/batch-check) instead of this in-memory cache — see
 * authorization/authorizationService.ts.
 *
 * `can` fails closed: false while loading/unauthenticated, never "allowed"
 * on an unknown state.
