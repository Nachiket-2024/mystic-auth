 * spinner while a request is in flight, then the matching-row count once it
 * resolves, inside the box's own right edge - not as a separate element next
 * to it, and only while there's actual text in the box. Without this, typing
 * a search/filter value that doesn't visibly change the current page's rows
 * (e.g. it only affects which page 2+ would show) looks like it silently did
 * nothing; showing a leftover count after clearing the box back to empty
 * (stale until the unfiltered refetch resolves, then just irrelevant once it
 * does) would look just as broken, so the hint is gated on the box being
 * non-empty rather than on the request being for "the current" value.
