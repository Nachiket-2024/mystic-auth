/**
 * Public extension surface for feature code built on top of this template
 * (see docs/mystic_auth/template-usage/overview.md).
 *
 * Import from HERE, not internal paths like "../authorization/useAuthorization"
 * directly — one file to discover what's available, and one file to reconcile
 * when pulling in upstream template updates instead of every call site.
 *
 * Everything below is a straight re-export; see the original module for the
 * "why" behind any given piece.
 *
 * DO NOT hand-edit this file. Treat it as a drop-in you receive from
 * upstream, not a place to add your own re-exports — this is the one file a
 * `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` sync is expected to touch, and local edits
 * here are exactly what turns that sync into a manual conflict instead of
 * applying cleanly. If you need your own re-exports for your own domain
 * code, add them to app_sdk.ts instead — it's the counterpart file kept
 * empty by upstream for exactly this purpose, so it never conflicts on a
 * sync.
