 * While isAuthenticated is still unknown (the initial session check hasn't resolved yet),
 * renders nothing at all — never children, and never `fallback` either — since showing a "you
 * don't have permission" fallback before we've even confirmed the user's identity would itself
 * be a flash of incorrect state, just the opposite kind from prematurely showing protected
 * content.
