  // No custom build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks here — a prior
  // version forced every node_modules import into one "vendor" chunk for
  // better long-term caching (rarely-changing third-party code under a
  // stable hash, separate from app code that changes every deploy). That
  // broke production: app/src files like api/axiosInstance.ts both import
  // from and get imported by that vendor chunk, and Rollup placed shared
  // CJS-interop helpers into axiosInstance's own chunk — creating a real
  // circular chunk dependency. ESM's live-binding semantics for circular
  // imports meant vendor.js called a binding from axiosInstance.js's chunk
  // before that chunk's module body had run far enough to define it,
  // throwing "TypeError: t is not a function" at the very top of the
  // vendor bundle — the whole app failed to mount, a blank page with no
  // build-time warning. Reverting to Rollup's own automatic chunking
  // (its default module-graph analysis doesn't create this circular
  // dependency) trades away that caching optimization for a build that
  // actually works; re-introduce chunking later only with real production
  // verification (not just curl on the built files) that nothing crashes.
