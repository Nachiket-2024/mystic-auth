# isolation) as tests/backend/integration/ and tests/backend/security/ —
# performance tests run against the same real Postgres/Redis, seeded with
# realistic bulk volume via direct SQL (seeding hundreds of rows through
# the HTTP API one at a time would itself dominate the timing being
# measured).
