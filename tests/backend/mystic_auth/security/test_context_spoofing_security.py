# tests/backend/mystic_auth/security/test_context_spoofing_security.py
#
# Real-DB proof that request_context_builder.build_authorization_context
# is actually used for real decisions, and a client cannot influence it —
# claude.md's "context spoofing attempts". Uses POST /authorization/batch-
# check as the enforcement vehicle: unlike the admin inspection endpoint
# (which deliberately accepts caller-supplied context for "what if"
# simulation), batch-check always builds its context from the real
# request, never the body/headers.
#
# httpx's ASGITransport (see conftest.py's `client` fixture) reports the
# connection as ("127.0.0.1", 123) by default — i.e. every request in this
# suite has a real client IP of 127.0.0.1, regardless of any header a test
# sends.
