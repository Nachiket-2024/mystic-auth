#
# Regression guard for an intermittent verify-account failure reported
# during earlier production-audit work (see concerns.md): chaining
# signup -> create a verification token -> immediately verify it, for many
# accounts in quick succession, was once observed to occasionally reject a
# token as "Invalid, expired, or already used" even though the token had
# just been issued and nothing else writes to the "verify:*" Redis
# keyspace. Two rounds of focused Redis-level tracing (redis-cli MONITOR,
# sequential and concurrent, well over 1000 chains total) never reproduced
# it, so no fix was made. This test exists so that if the underlying
# condition recurs, CI catches it instead of relying on another manual
# investigation.
