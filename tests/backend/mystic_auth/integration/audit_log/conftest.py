# tests/backend/mystic_auth/integration/audit_log/conftest.py
#
# Runs the real `procrastinate ... worker` CLI as a subprocess for the
# whole test session, pointed at this suite's database. A plain local
# `pytest` run has no separate `procrastinate_worker` container, and audit
# log rows (see authorization_audit_logger.log_decision) only appear once
# some worker consumes the queue. poll_for_entries
# (audit_log_test_accounts.py) polls for exactly that, so without a worker
# draining the queue it always times out and sees nothing.
#
# A real subprocess, not an in-process asyncio worker task: an earlier
# version ran a `procrastinate.worker.Worker` loop as a background asyncio
# task inside the test process, and it reliably deadlocked partway through
# a run, most likely fighting the top-level conftest's per-test connector
# cycling over an event loop. A separate OS process has its own event loop
# entirely, so it can't collide no matter how this suite's fixtures churn.
#
# Scoped to this directory, not the top-level conftest.py: the rest of the
# real-DB suite doesn't defer/poll through the audit log, so there's no
# reason to pay for a worker process there.
