# Regression guard for get_client_ip: this app was previously vulnerable to
# IP spoofing via a caller-supplied X-Forwarded-For header, and later to
# mistaking a second trusted proxy hop's own address for the real client
# (see client_ip.py's own docstring for both). These tests pin the fixed
# behavior: XFF is only trusted from a configured reverse proxy, and even
# then the header is walked from the right, discarding any entry that is
# itself a known trusted-proxy hop, until the first (real, non-forgeable)
# entry that isn't.
