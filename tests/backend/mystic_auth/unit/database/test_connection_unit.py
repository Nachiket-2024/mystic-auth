# tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/database/test_connection_unit.py
#
# Database is a module-level singleton built once at import time; this
# guards its actual engine/session configuration (URL, pool settings,
# expire_on_commit), since nothing else in the suite asserts on it, and a
# regression here (e.g. losing pool_pre_ping) would only surface as an
# intermittent "connection already closed" under real production load, not
# as a test failure anywhere else.
#
# Pool/session assertions below construct a fresh Database(...) rather than
# inspecting the global `database` singleton's own .engine/.async_session:
# tests/backend/conftest.py deliberately reassigns those two attributes on
# the shared singleton to a NullPool engine for the whole test session (see
# its own comment), so asserting on the singleton here would really be
# asserting on conftest's override, not on Database's own default behavior.
