# Regression test for scripts/mystic_auth/db/db_restore_drill.sh. Needs a
# running `postgres` service (the dev Compose stack, already up in CI's
# docker-build job before this runs) - unlike the env-tools regression
# suite, this genuinely needs a live database, not a throwaway temp dir.
#
# Covers the real bug found building the drill itself: pg_dump --file=-
# silently wrote a 0-byte dump on this image's pg_dump build instead of
# writing to stdout, and db_backup.sh used exactly that pattern. Both
# scripts now omit --file and rely on stdout redirection instead - see
# their own comments at the fixed line.
#
# Usage (from repo root, dev stack's postgres already up):
#   tests/scripts/mystic_auth/db/test-restore-drill.sh
