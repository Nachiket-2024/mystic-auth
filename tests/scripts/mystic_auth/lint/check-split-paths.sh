# Regression guard for the class of bug found live in this repo three
# separate times in one session: docker/, env/, and scripts/ each got
# split into mystic_auth/ + app/ subfolders, but a comment, doc, or a
# script that builds a path at runtime (rather than a literal, fully
# spelled-out script path token check-script-paths.sh already validates)
# kept referencing the old unsplit location. Each one silently broke a
# real workflow (alembic locally, a Playwright E2E helper, pytest's own
# localhost-derivation) with no error pointing at the actual cause.
#
# check-script-paths.sh already validates every scripts/local-scripts/
# path ending in .sh/.py/.ps1/.cmd/.bat actually exists. This script
# covers what that one can't: literal pre-split path substrings
# (env/.env, docker/compose/, docker/dockerfiles/, docker/postgres-init/,
# docker/Caddyfile, docker/nginx.frontend.conf) appearing anywhere in
# source, scripts, or docs - these don't reliably end in a checkable file
# extension (a .yml Dockerfile path, a bare directory reference in a
# comment), so an existence check can't catch them; a denylist can.
#
# Excluded on purpose, same reasoning as check-script-paths.sh:
#   - This script's own file: the patterns list below necessarily
#     contains the literal strings being searched for.
#   - docs/mystic_auth/project-story/ and docker/validation-history.md:
#     historical narrative describing paths as they were at the time.
#   - tests/scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/test-sync-upstream.sh:
#     builds its own fixture repo with pre-split paths on purpose, to
#     simulate a consumer syncing from an old template version.
#   - tests/scripts/mystic_auth/lint/check-script-paths.sh: its own
#     docstring names the real pre-split paths from the bug it was built
#     to catch, as history, not a live reference.
#
# Usage: tests/scripts/mystic_auth/lint/check-split-paths.sh
# Exit 0: no pre-split path found. Exit 1: one or more found, listed.
