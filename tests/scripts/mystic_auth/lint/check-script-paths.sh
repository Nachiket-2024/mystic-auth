# Regression guard for exactly the class of bug found live in this repo:
# quickstart.sh/quickstart.ps1 called `./scripts/env-tools/...` and
# `./scripts/docker/...` (missing the `mystic_auth/` segment) after an
# earlier restructuring commit, so the #1 command in README.md failed on
# line 1 for every new user. Nothing caught that until someone actually ran
# it by hand.
#
# Scans every script (.sh/.ps1/.cmd/.bat), every Makefile (root and
# makefiles/*/), and every doc (.md) for a path token containing
# `scripts/` or `local-scripts/` and ending in
# .sh/.py/.ps1/.cmd/.bat (forward-slash or backslash), and asserts the
# target file actually exists. Matches the whole contiguous path token
# (e.g. `backend/mystic_auth/scripts/create_system_user.py`), not just the
# `scripts/...` suffix, so a real path with more segments before `scripts/`
# isn't misreported as missing.
#
# Also scans every Dockerfile's `COPY <src> ...` lines (skipping
# `--from=` multi-stage copies) and asserts each source exists relative
# to the repo root - `docker compose config` never checks these.
#
# Excluded on purpose:
#   - This script's own file: its usage comment uses placeholder example
#     paths that don't exist by design.
#   - docs/mystic_auth/project-story/ and docker/validation-history.md:
#     historical narrative describing paths as they were at the time, not
#     the current tree - "fixing" these would misrepresent history.
#   - tests/scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/test-sync-upstream.sh:
#     creates its own fixture paths dynamically inside a temp sandbox
#     repo, never in this repo's tree.
#
# Usage: tests/scripts/mystic_auth/lint/check-script-paths.sh
# Exit 0: every referenced path resolves. Exit 1: one or more don't, listed.
