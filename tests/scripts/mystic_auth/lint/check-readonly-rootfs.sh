# Regression guard for the 2026-10-05 infra security audit (claude_code_infra,
# area G/O, F-011): no compose service ran with a read-only root filesystem -
# confirmed live via Docker Bench for Security's CIS 5.13 check. Fixed for
# the services where the fix was live-tested end to end against
# docker-compose.local-prod-ngrok.yml (postgres, valkey, backend, frontend,
# procrastinate_worker, alembic, geoipupdate, db_backup, bugsink,
# bugsink-seed) and the same pattern carried to the other local-prod/prod
# compose files.
#
# Intentionally NOT required here: ngrok, cloudflared, tailscale, and caddy.
# Each is a third-party vendor image whose internal entrypoint writes to
# paths this repo doesn't control (ngrok rewrites its own config file into
# /var/lib/ngrok on every start - verified live: tmpfs-mounting that
# directory erases the image's baked-in default config and the container
# restart-loops), and cloudflared/tailscale/caddy need real provider
# credentials this session didn't have to test live. See each service's own
# comment in its compose file.
#
# Usage: tests/scripts/mystic_auth/lint/check-readonly-rootfs.sh
# Exit 0: every required service has read_only: true. Exit 1: one or more
# don't, listed.
#
# Scoped to the local-prod-*/prod compose files only: docker-compose.dev.yml
# bind-mounts live source into these same containers for hot-reload (npm
# install, editable installs), which a read-only rootfs would break, and
# dev's own threat model doesn't call for this hardening the way an
# internet-facing mode does.
