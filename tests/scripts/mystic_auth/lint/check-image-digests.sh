# Regression guard for the bug found live in the 2026-10-05 security audit
# (claude_code_auth, area A/B/C, F-001): docker-compose.local-prod-ngrok.yml
# pinned the geoipupdate image to a sha256 digest that was one hex character
# short (63 chars instead of 64) - a typo copy-pasted into all four
# production-shaped compose files. `docker pull`/`docker compose ...
# --profile geoip up` fails outright on a clean host with "invalid checksum
# digest length", and nothing short of actually pulling the image caught it:
# `docker compose config` happily accepts a malformed digest string.
#
# Scans every docker/{mystic_auth,app}/compose/docker-compose.*.yml for an
# `@sha256:<hex>` image pin and asserts the hex portion is exactly 64
# characters.
#
# Usage: tests/scripts/mystic_auth/lint/check-image-digests.sh
# Exit 0: every pinned digest is 64 hex characters. Exit 1: one or more
# aren't, listed.
