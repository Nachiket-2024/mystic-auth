"""add five scoped policies

Revision ID: e0291417b733
Revises: e7a2c4d8f1b3
Create Date: 2026-08-22 00:00:00.000000

Seeds five additional, non-protected policies alongside the three original
baseline ones (self_service, user_administration, system_superuser), each
scoped to exactly one resource_type so every action in it actually takes
effect (see policy_evaluator.py: a policy only matches when
resource_type == its own resource_type, or "*"):

  - policy_administration (resource_type "policies"): full policy-system
    management - read/create/update/delete/assign/revoke.
  - policy_maintainer (resource_type "policies"): a narrower slice of the
    above - read/update/revoke only, for fixing or locking down an
    existing policy without being able to author new ones or reassign
    who's exempt from a delete/revoke escalation guard.
  - rate_limit_administration (resource_type "rate_limits"): read/reset.
  - security_audit_administration (resource_type "security_audit"): read.
  - user_lifecycle_administration (resource_type "users"): purge/reactivate.

These were originally created ad hoc through the management API (POST
/authorization/policies), which is normally sufficient for a genuinely
custom, one-off policy (see docs/mystic_auth/authorization/
adding-permissions.md's "brand-new policy" guidance) - but a policy that
only exists as a database row doesn't survive a fresh volume/environment
the way the three migration-seeded baseline policies do. Promoted to a
migration so they're always present after `alembic upgrade head`, same as
the original three - not because they're privileged/protected
(PROTECTED_POLICY_NAMES in policy_route_dependencies.py deliberately does
NOT include these five: they stay a normal, editable/deletable policy,
unlike the three true baseline ones the system depends on to function at
all).
