Per claude.md's Database Optimization task — evidence-based, not
speculative. Analysis performed directly against the Docker PostgreSQL
container (postgres:15) seeded with ~10k users, ~30k policy assignments,
and ~220k audit log rows (one user seeded with ~20k rows to model a
heavily-audited account):

  EXPLAIN ANALYZE on AuditLogRepository.get_for_user's actual query
  (`WHERE user_email = :email ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC LIMIT
  :limit OFFSET :offset`) showed, for the heavily-audited user: an
  Incremental Sort over a created_at-backward index scan with a
  post-filter on user_email (0.200ms) — i.e. Postgres could not use the
  existing single-column `ix_authorization_audit_log_user_email` index to
  also satisfy the ORDER BY, so it fell back to scanning by created_at
  and filtering, plus a separate sort.

  Adding a composite index on (user_email, created_at DESC, id DESC)
  measurably eliminated the sort step entirely for that same query
  (0.135ms; plan became a single direct Index Scan, already presorted) —
  confirmed by re-running EXPLAIN ANALYZE with the new index present.

The old single-column `ix_authorization_audit_log_user_email` index is
dropped as part of this same migration: grep confirmed user_email is
never queried anywhere in this codebase without this exact ORDER BY (see
audit_log_repository.py's get_for_user — the only place that filters by
user_email at all), so the composite index's leftmost prefix (user_email
alone) already serves that access pattern; keeping the old index would be
pure redundant write overhead on audit log inserts, which happen on
*every* real authorize()/require() call — the hottest write path in the
whole application.

Note: the equivalent composite index was also evaluated for
policy_history (policy_name, created_at DESC, id DESC), which has the
identical query shape in PolicyHistoryRepository.get_for_policy. At
policy_history's realistic scale (history entries accumulate only from
infrequent admin policy edits, not per-request traffic), EXPLAIN ANALYZE
showed Postgres's planner declined to use that composite index even when
it was present, continuing to prefer the existing created_at-backward-
scan-and-filter plan — i.e. no demonstrated benefit at that table's
actual usage pattern. That index was therefore NOT added here, per
claude.md's "add indexes only with demonstrated need" — see this
migration's absence of any policy_history change as the direct evidence
of that finding, not an oversight.
