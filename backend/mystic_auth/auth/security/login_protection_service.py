        The is_locked check here vs. a caller's own pre-check (e.g.
        login_handler.py checks is_locked itself before attempting
        authentication, to skip the password hash comparison entirely for an
        already-locked account) are not redundant despite calling the same
        function. The caller's pre-check answers "should we even try?" before
        any expensive work; this one answers "is the account still unlocked
        right now, after that work finished?" — closing the race where a
        concurrent request locks the account in between. Removing either one
        changes behavior: dropping the caller's pre-check means every attempt
        against a locked account still pays for a full password hash
        comparison, and dropping this one lets a login that happens to finish
        just after a concurrent failure crosses the threshold slip through anyway.
