        max_requests/window_seconds override the global
        MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW/REQUEST_WINDOW_SECONDS defaults for this one
        endpoint - e.g. a rarely-hit route like password-reset-request
        wants a tighter limit than the high-traffic login route shares by
        default. Give both together or neither; either given alone still
        falls back to the global default for the other.

        account_key_func, if given, extracts an account identifier (e.g. email)
        from the endpoint's resolved keyword arguments, since FastAPI always calls the
        wrapped endpoint with its dependencies as kwargs, so this can pull
        straight from the parsed request body/params (e.g.
        `lambda kwargs: kwargs["payload"].email`). May be sync or async (the
        wrapper below awaits the result iff it's awaitable) - a token-only
        route (e.g. get_current_user, logout) has no such field to read
        synchronously, only an encoded access_token cookie, so its
        account_key_func decodes that instead (see
        auth_routes.py's `_access_token_account_key`, backed by
        jwt_service.decode_payload - real signature+expiry verification, just
        skipping the revocation lookup verify_token also does, so this stays
        a local CPU-bound decode with no extra Redis round trip). Pass None
        for endpoints with no account identifier available by either means.
        When supplied, it adds a per-account limit, keyed independently of
        IP: this closes the gap where an attacker spreads requests targeting
        one account across many source IPs specifically to stay under the
        per-IP threshold, which a per-IP-only limiter would never flag as
        abuse.

        redirect_url, if given, is used instead of the default JSON 429 body
        when the limit is exceeded. Only meaningful for endpoints that are
        themselves a top-level browser navigation (e.g. the OAuth2 routes,
        which always return a RedirectResponse) - a raw JSON body has
        nowhere sensible to render there.
