# HTML this otherwise-JSON-only API serves, and the one place the blanket
# `default-src 'none'` CSP below can't apply as-is: both pages load their
# JS/CSS from a CDN (Swagger UI's inline init script too), and ReDoc pulls a
# Google Fonts stylesheet, so the strict policy left them silently rendering
# as a blank page (200 OK, but every asset blocked) rather than an error
# anyone would notice was CSP, not a real failure. /openapi.json itself is
# plain JSON and doesn't need the relaxed policy, but including it here is
# harmless since a JSON response has nothing for a CSP to block anyway.
