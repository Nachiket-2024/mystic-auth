        access_token is needed by both /auth/me and every route under /users/*,
        so it has to stay scoped to the whole site ("/", the default when no
        path is given). refresh_token, however, is only ever read by
        /auth/refresh, /auth/logout, and /auth/logout/all — all under /auth —
        so scoping it to path="/auth" means it's never sent on requests to
        /users/* or anywhere else that never needed it, without breaking any
        route that does. logout_handler and logout_all_handler's delete_cookie
        calls must specify the same path, or the browser will treat the delete
        as a different cookie and leave this one behind.
