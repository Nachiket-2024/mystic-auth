        it unverified, and silently inherit access the moment the real owner later
        signs in with Google: the account would become verified while the
        attacker's password remained valid, letting them log in as the victim
        indefinitely. Clearing hashed_password severs that password the instant
        Google proves the real owner's identity, so only the legitimate owner (via
        Google, or by setting a fresh password afterwards) can authenticate into
        the account from this point on. A previously *verified* account's password
        is never touched: that password was already proven to belong to this
