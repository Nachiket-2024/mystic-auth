    """
    Hard-delete path shared by the admin `DELETE /users/{email}/purge` route
    (user_lifecycle_routes.py::purge_user) and the scheduled grace-period
    purge job (procrastinate_tasks/account_purge_tasks.py), so both go
    through the same revoke -> anonymize-history -> audit -> delete
    sequence instead of two independently-maintained copies.

    Takes a row lock on the user and, if it was already soft-deleted when
    this call was made, re-checks that it still is before doing anything
    irreversible: `user` may have been read well before this call (the
    nightly job reads its whole batch up front, then loops), and without
    this re-check a reactivation landing in that gap would still get
    permanently purged on the stale snapshot. The lock also closes the
    window against a reactivation racing in concurrently with this call
    itself, not just one that happened earlier. An admin purging a
    still-active account directly (never soft-deleted) is unaffected: there
    is no deleted_at precondition to regress on in that case. Raises
    AccountNoLongerEligibleForPurgeError if the row no longer exists, or if
    it was soft-deleted at call time but no longer is; both callers must
    handle this themselves.

    Sessions are revoked and the action audit-logged before the row is
    deleted: the audit write is what makes the action reviewable afterward,
    and `user_id`'s ON DELETE CASCADE would otherwise remove Manage Sessions
    rows out from under a post-delete revoke call.

    Raises TokenVersionUnavailableError, uncaught, if the account-version
    bump can't be confirmed (Valkey unreachable). Unlike a reversible soft
    delete, this fails closed on purpose since the row deletion hasn't
    happened yet at that point; better to block an irreversible purge on an
    unconfirmed revoke than delete an account while its sessions might still
    be alive. Both callers must handle this themselves.
