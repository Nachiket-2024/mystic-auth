    reasoning as every other best-effort side-channel in this codebase

    Deliberately just a "something changed, go check" signal, not "you are
    logged out": the receiving tab might be a completely different,
    unaffected session (see refresh_token_service.revoke_chain_for_user),
    so the actual authoritative answer still comes from the normal
    request/response auth checks, never from this event's payload.

    Sessions would only learn about a fresh login on another device via its

    rate_limits:read - would keep rendering with its now-stale cached
    permissions (useCurrentUserQuery's own 2-minute refetchInterval) until
    that poll, a window-focus refetch, or a manual reload: exactly the
    "revoked access still visibly usable for a while" gap this exists to

    handler as revoke/created (useSessionEventsStream already invalidates
    CURRENT_USER_QUERY_KEY on any message) rather than adding a second

    Yields Server-Sent-Events-formatted lines on `email`'s own channel
    until the client disconnects. One Redis Pub/Sub subscription per open
    tab: fine at this app's scale (a handful of users, not millions
    of concurrent connections); a larger deployment would front this with
    a proper pub/sub fan-out layer instead of one subscription per
    connection.

    Deliberately does NOT poll request.is_disconnected() to end the loop
    early: this app's LoggingMiddleware (see logging/logging_middleware.py)
    is a BaseHTTPMiddleware, and Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware is documented
    to make is_disconnected() unreliable for a downstream streaming endpoint
    - it was observed returning True on the very first check even with a
    live client, closing this stream within milliseconds of opening it. The
    browser's EventSource then auto-reconnected in a tight loop, and any
    publish_permissions_changed()/publish_session_revoked() fired during one
    of the resulting gaps was silently lost (Redis pub/sub doesn't replay to
    a subscriber that wasn't connected at publish time) - exactly the "stays
    on a just-revoked page until a manual refresh" bug this stream exists to
    prevent. A real disconnect is still caught without this check: the next
    `yield` after the socket closes fails to send, which surfaces here as
    asyncio.CancelledError (handled below) or propagates out to the finally
