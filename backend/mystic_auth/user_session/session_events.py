    Yields Server-Sent-Events-formatted lines on `email`'s own channel
    until the client disconnects. One Valkey Pub/Sub subscription per open
    tab: fine at this app's scale (a handful of users, not millions
    of concurrent connections); a larger deployment would front this with
    a proper pub/sub fan-out layer instead of one subscription per
    connection.

    Deliberately does NOT poll request.is_disconnected() to end the loop
    early: this app's LoggingMiddleware (see logging/logging_middleware.py)
    is a BaseHTTPMiddleware, and Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware is documented
    to make is_disconnected() unreliable for a downstream streaming endpoint
    - it was observed returning True on the very first check even with a
    live client, closing this stream within milliseconds of opening it. The
    browser's EventSource then auto-reconnected in a tight loop, and any
    publish_permissions_changed()/publish_session_revoked() fired during one
    of the resulting gaps was silently lost (Valkey pub/sub doesn't replay to
    a subscriber that wasn't connected at publish time) - exactly the "stays
    on a just-revoked page until a manual refresh" bug this stream exists to
    prevent. A real disconnect is still caught without this check: the next
    `yield` after the socket closes fails to send, which surfaces here as
    asyncio.CancelledError (handled below) or propagates out to the finally
    block either way.

    Bounded instead by _MAX_CONNECTION_SECONDS (a periodic clean cutoff the
    client's EventSource just reconnects from) and _shutdown_event (an
    immediate clean stop on SIGTERM/reload) - see both module-level comments
    above. Neither closes the stream the way the old is_disconnected() bug
    did: that was closing within milliseconds of opening, over and over,
    with the client racing to reconnect the whole time. These fire at most
    once per _MAX_CONNECTION_SECONDS, or once, ever, per process shutdown -
    ordinary long-lived connections are unaffected in between.

    `access_token` (optional, passed by the route) is re-verified on every
    heartbeat cycle (at most once per _HEARTBEAT_SECONDS): without this, a
    connection opened with a valid token stayed open and kept its lease/
    pubsub slot for up to _MAX_CONNECTION_SECONDS even after that token was
    revoked mid-connection (logout-all, password change, a targeted
    revoke). The channel only ever carries a generic "something changed, go
    check" signal, never session/permission data, so the leaked-slot/stale-
    connection gap was defense-in-depth, not a data exposure - this closes
    it anyway rather than relying solely on the hard cap. None (no token
    passed, e.g. in a test that constructs the generator directly) skips
    the check, matching the old behavior.
