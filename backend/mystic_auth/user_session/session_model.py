class UserSession(Base):
    """
    One row per login session, surfaced on the "Manage Sessions" dashboard
    card so a user can see (and selectively end) every device they're
    currently signed in on.

    Refresh tokens are single-use and rotate their jti on every
    /auth/refresh call (see refresh_token_service.py), so the jti itself
    can't be this row's stable identity - `current_jti` tracks whichever
    jti currently represents this session, updated in place on each
    rotation (see session_repository.rotate), while `id` stays the stable
    identifier shown to and revoked by the client, and `chain_id` is the
    identity Valkey actually keys revocation off (see below).

    Real token validity is governed entirely by Valkey version counters
    (jwt_service.py: `account_ver:{email}` account-wide, `chain_ver:
    {email}:{chain_id}` per-session), not by anything in this table. This
    table is a best-effort mirror for display and for knowing which
    chain_id to bump when a specific session is revoked by id. A row here
    going missing or stale never affects login/refresh correctness (see
    session_service.py's try/except-everywhere), the same reasoning as
    security_audit_log's independence from the actual auth decision it
    records.
