    Interactive CLI script to create the one-time system superuser — or, if
    the email you give already belongs to an existing account (e.g. someone
    who forgot to bootstrap this first and just signed up/logged in via
    Google to test), promote that account instead, after an explicit
    confirmation. Branches on whether that existing account has a password:

    - **No password at all (a Google-only account)**: can't be promoted in
      place. A system account can't use Google login (see
      docs/mystic_auth/authentication/oauth2-pkce.md's "system account is
      blocked from OAuth2 login entirely"), and this account has no password
      either — promoting it as-is would leave it with literally no way to
      log in afterward. Offers to delete that account and immediately fall
      into the normal creation flow instead (same email, fresh name/password
      prompts) — a clean account, not a half-broken one.
    - **Has a password already**: promotes in place — assigns the missing
      baseline policies (see SYSTEM_USER_POLICY_NAMES above, the actual
      source of PBAC access, never `role`), sets `role` to `system` too (not
      strictly required for access, but keeps the account's shape consistent
      with the one this script normally creates, and is what actually
      disables future Google login for it), and requires setting a new
      password as part of the promotion — the operator running this script
      may not be the one who originally set it, and a system-level account
      shouldn't rely on a password nobody currently running this can verify.

    Either way, this only ever assigns/updates rows this script's own
    operator explicitly confirmed — never a silent upsert.

    Deliberately CLI-only — there is still no API endpoint that can create or
    promote a user, by design.

    Run once manually before first launch, or any time you need to promote
    an existing account:
