    who forgot to bootstrap this first and signed up/logged in via Google
    to test), promote that account instead after explicit confirmation.
    Branches on whether that existing account has a password:

    - **No password at all (a Google-only account)**: can't be promoted in
      place. A system account can't use Google login, and this account has
      no password either, so promoting it as-is would leave it with no way
      to log in. Offers to delete that account and fall into the normal
      creation flow instead (same email, fresh name/password prompts).
    - **Has a password already**: promotes in place. Assigns the missing
      baseline policies (see SYSTEM_USER_POLICY_NAMES above, the actual
      source of PBAC access, never `role`), sets `role` to `system` too
      (keeps the account's shape consistent with one this script normally
      creates, and disables future Google login for it), and requires
      setting a new password, since the operator running this script may
      not be the one who originally set it.

    Either way, this only ever assigns/updates rows the operator explicitly
    confirmed, never a silent upsert.

    Deliberately CLI-only: there is still no API endpoint that can create or
    promote a user, by design.

    Run once manually before first launch, or any time you need to promote
    an existing account:
