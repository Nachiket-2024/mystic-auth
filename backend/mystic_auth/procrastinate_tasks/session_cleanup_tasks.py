    in session_repository.py already delete their rows immediately, so
    there's nothing left for this job to find in that case - this only
    catches a token that simply timed out with no logout call).

    Runs daily at 03:30 UTC, 30 minutes after
    purge_expired_soft_deleted_accounts so the two batch jobs (same worker
    process, both @app.periodic) don't overlap. `timestamp` is the
    scheduled cron tick Procrastinate calls this with; unused here since the
    cutoff is computed from the current time, not the tick time, same
    reasoning as account_purge_tasks.py.

    Safe to delete unconditionally, no per-row confirmation needed (unlike
    the account purge job's Valkey-confirmed revoke): session_model.py's own
    docstring establishes Valkey's version counters, not this table, as the
    source of truth for actual token validity, so a stale row disappearing
    here can never affect a live login/refresh decision.
