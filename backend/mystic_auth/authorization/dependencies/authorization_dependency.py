    """
    Returns a FastAPI dependency usable as
    `Depends(require_authorization("users:list_all", "users"))` that
    authenticates the caller, builds the request's authorization context
    (real connection/server clock only — never anything client-supplied,
    see context/request_context_builder.py), and delegates the actual
    decision entirely to AuthorizationService.require. On success it
    returns the authenticated current_user dict for the route to use.

    This is the PBAC replacement for the RBAC-era
    authorization.permission_checker.require_permission (removed) — routes
    declare *what action on what resource* they need; the authorization
    service and policy evaluation engine behind it decide *who currently
    has that*, based entirely on assigned policies. No role ever enters
    this decision, and this dependency itself never inspects
    current_user["role"].
