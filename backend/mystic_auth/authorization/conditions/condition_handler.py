    One condition type's evaluation logic (e.g. "self_only", "time",
    "network"). The ConditionEvaluationService dispatches to whichever
    handler is registered for a given condition key via
    ConditionRegistry — the evaluator (PolicyEvaluationEngine) never
    contains condition-specific logic itself, so adding a new condition
    type never requires touching the evaluator or the service, only
    registering a new handler (see conditions/condition_registry.py).

    Every handler must fail safe: malformed condition config, missing
    required context/resource, or any internal error must result in
    `evaluate` returning False (deny), never raising past this boundary
    and never silently allowing.
