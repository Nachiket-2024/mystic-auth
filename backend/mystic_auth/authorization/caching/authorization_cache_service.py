class AuthorizationCacheService:
    """
    The single, centralized Redis abstraction for authorization data — per
    claude.md's Authorization Performance Layer: "Create centralized Redis
    abstraction layer (single module)" / "Do not scatter Redis calls
    throughout authorization code". Only policy_repository.py calls this;
    nothing else in the authorization module (the service, the evaluator,
    routes) talks to Redis directly for authorization purposes.

    Cache target — deliberately scoped to one:
        get_active_policies_for_user's result (a user's active, assigned
        policy list) — the one authorization-hot-path DB query that runs
        on literally every authorize() call, is expensive (a two-table
        join), rarely changes, and is only ever read-consumed downstream
        (never fed back into a database mutation).

    Explicitly NOT cached in this pass, and why:
        - "Policy lookup [by name]": get_by_name's result is routinely
          fetched immediately before being passed into
          PolicyRepository.update()/delete() (see api/pbac_routes/policy_crud_routes.py),
          which call session.add(db_obj)/session.delete(db_obj) on it. A
          cache-reconstructed, session-detached object with a pre-set
          primary key handed to session.add() risks SQLAlchemy treating it
          as a new pending INSERT (since the session's identity map has
          never seen that PK), which would raise an IntegrityError on
          flush instead of performing the intended UPDATE. Caching this
          safely would need either a `session.merge()` step wherever a
          cached policy might be mutated, or a hard split between "cached,
          read-only" and "always-fresh, mutable" call sites — real, but
          separate, work: left as a documented follow-up rather than
          shipped half-correct.
        - "Evaluation results" (the final allow/deny for a specific
          action+resource+context): several condition types (time,
          date_range, network, security_context) are legitimately
          request-context-dependent — the same (user, action,
          resource_type) can correctly evaluate differently a minute later,
          or from a different IP. Caching the *decision* risks serving a
          stale answer for exactly the conditions designed to be
          time/context-sensitive. Caching the *policy list* (this module)
          already removes the one expensive part (the DB round trip);
          evaluating that list against the current resource/context is
          pure in-memory computation, so there is no meaningful
          performance case left for caching the decision itself, only
          correctness risk.

    Fail-closed, precisely: every method here fails closed *with respect to
    the cache*, never with respect to authorization itself. Any Redis
    error (connection failure, timeout, corrupt payload) is caught and
    logged, and the method returns a cache-miss sentinel (None) rather than
    raising or returning something possibly wrong. The caller
    (policy_repository.get_active_policies_for_user) then falls through to
    the authoritative database query on any miss — the one source of truth
    this cache can never disagree with, since it is populated *from* it and
    invalidated whenever it changes. That is what "fail closed" means here:
    the cache is never trusted over the database. It does not mean "deny
    every authorization request whenever Redis is unreachable" — that would
    turn a transient cache outage into an application-wide denial of
    service, strictly worse than falling back to the database evaluation
    this cache exists only to speed up.
