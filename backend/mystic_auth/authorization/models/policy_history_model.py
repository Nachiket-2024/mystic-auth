class PolicyHistory(Base):
    """
    One immutable row per policy mutation (create/update/delete/rollback).
    Rollback creates a new version rather than overwriting history.
    Written by PolicyRepository's create/update/delete, so no route needs
    to log anything itself.

    No foreign key to `policies` (same rationale as AuthorizationAuditLog,
    see audit_log_model.py): a referenced policy id may since be reused or
    deleted, and history must reflect what existed at the time, not what
    that id means now. `policy_name` is the durable lookup key, valid even
    after the policy row is gone.
