class PolicyHistory(Base):
    """
    One immutable row per policy mutation (create/update/delete/rollback) —
    per claude.md's "Policy Versioning and Change History": policy changes
    must be fully traceable and reversible, and rollback must create a new
    version, never overwrite history. Written by PolicyRepository's
    create/update/delete (the only places policies are ever mutated), so no
    route needs to log anything itself.

    Deliberately no foreign key to `policies` — mirrors
    AuthorizationAuditLog's own rationale (see audit_log_model.py): a policy
    referenced by an old history entry may since have been edited, deleted,
    or (in principle) have its id reused, and the history must keep
    reflecting exactly what existed *at the time*, not whatever that id
    currently means. `policy_name` is the durable identifier used to query
    a policy's full history even after the policy itself is deleted.
