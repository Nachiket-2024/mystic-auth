    """
    One row per authorization decision (per claude.md's Remaining PBAC
    Work: "Authorization decisions must be auditable" / "Automatically log
    every authorize() call"). Written by
    AuthorizationService.authorize_detailed — the single choke point every
    authorize()/require() call goes through — so no protected route or
    caller needs to log anything itself.

    Deliberately append-only and independent of the policies/user_policies
    tables (no foreign keys to Policy): a policy referenced by an old audit
    entry may since have been edited or deleted, and the audit trail must
    keep reflecting exactly what was evaluated *at the time*, not whatever
    that policy id currently means. Policy names, not just ids, are stored
    for the same reason — a renamed or deleted policy's audit history
    should still read as which policy(ies) were involved.
