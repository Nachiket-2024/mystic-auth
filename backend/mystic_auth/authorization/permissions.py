    """
    MysticAuth's built-in vocabulary of action identifiers usable in a
    Policy's `actions` list, checked via require_authorization or
    AuthorizationService.authorize/require. Downstream applications may use
    additional opaque action strings without adding them here.

    Represents possible actions only, no role -> action mapping: the only
    thing that grants an action to a user is an assigned, active Policy
    whose `actions` include it (see evaluators/policy_evaluator.py).

    Naming convention: "<resource>:<action>[_<scope>]", e.g.
    USERS_UPDATE_OWN vs USERS_UPDATE_ANY are genuinely different actions
    since a policy can grant one without the other.
