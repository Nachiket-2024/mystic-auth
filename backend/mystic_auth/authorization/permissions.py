import enum


class Permission(str, enum.Enum):
    """
    The fixed vocabulary of action identifiers usable in a Policy's
    `actions` list (see authorization/models/policy_model.py) and checked
    via authorization.dependencies.authorization_dependency.require_authorization
    or authorization.services.authorization_service.authorize/require.

    Per claude.md: "Permissions represent possible actions only. ...
    Access is granted only when a policy evaluation allows the action."
    This enum is that action vocabulary — nothing more. It carries no
    role -> action mapping (that concept has been removed entirely); the
    only thing that ever grants an action to a user is an assigned,
    active Policy whose `actions` include it (see
    authorization/evaluators/policy_evaluator.py).

    Naming convention: "<resource>:<action>[_<scope>]", e.g.
    USERS_UPDATE_OWN vs USERS_UPDATE_ANY distinguishes "can edit my own
    profile" from "can edit anyone's profile" as genuinely different
    actions, since a policy can plausibly grant one without the other.
