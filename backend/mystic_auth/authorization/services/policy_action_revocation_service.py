    """
    Carves a single action out of a user's policy assignment, without
    touching the policy definition (other users may hold it too) and
    without dropping the user's other actions from that same policy.

    A Policy assignment is otherwise all-or-nothing: revoking it drops
    every action it granted, even ones the user should keep. Without this
    service, "lose exactly one action" means revoking the whole policy and
    manually re-granting the rest, or editing the policy definition
    itself (which affects every other holder). Neither matches "take one
    action away from one user".

    Implementation: in one transaction, remove the UserPolicy assignment
    row, then re-create (or reactivate) a direct UserPermission grant for
    each of the policy's other actions, carrying over its `conditions` so
    the user's effective access is unchanged except for the revoked
    action.

    One-shot conversion triggered by an explicit admin action, not a
    generic "diff a policy assignment" mechanism or a DB trigger.
