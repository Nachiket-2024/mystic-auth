    Partially updates a policy: only provided fields are applied (e.g. this
    can disable a policy via is_active=False without touching its actions).

    Baseline policies (self_service, user_administration, system_superuser)
    can't be renamed away from their well-known name, since default
    assignments (signup, oauth2, create_system_user.py) look them up by
    name. They also can't be deactivated: is_active=False excludes a policy
    from evaluation for every holder at once, and for system_superuser that
    would silently strip every superuser of all access, bypassing both the
    rename/delete guards and the separate lockout guard on
    remove_policy_from_user (which only fires on unassignment).

    If actions are changing, the caller must already hold every action the
    policy would grant afterwards: otherwise policies:update alone could
    re-grant an existing, possibly widely-assigned policy new actions the
    caller doesn't have.

    Symmetrically, changing actions/resource_type/conditions or deactivating requires
    the caller to already hold every action the policy *currently* grants
    (checked pre-update), not just the post-update grant-side check above.
    Otherwise policies:update alone could narrow, retarget, or deactivate a
    policy a more-privileged peer depends on, stripping their access. A
    A pure description edit, or reactivating (is_active=True), doesn't change
    what the policy grants. Changing conditions is a grant-scope change and
    is checked against the caller's own matching grants.
    See delete_policy and remove_policy_from_user (policy_assignment_routes.py)
    for the same guard applied to delete and revoke, where removal is
    always a downgrade.
