"""
Public extension surface for domain/feature code built on top of this
template (see docs/mystic_auth/template-usage.md).

Import from HERE, not internal paths like
`mystic_auth.authorization.dependencies.authorization_dependency` directly —
one file to discover what's available, and one file to reconcile when
pulling in upstream template updates instead of every call site.

`main.py` itself is held to the same rule: it imports only from this module,
never reaching into `mystic_auth/` directly, so the app's entry point and any
downstream app code share one boundary.

Everything below is a straight re-export; see the original module's
docstring for the "why" behind any given piece.

import importlib

# `mystic_auth` is a sibling package of `app`, not a child of it, so a plain
# relative import can't reach it, and a plain absolute one only resolves
# inside the Docker image, where the working directory is backend/ and
# `app`/`mystic_auth` are both top-level packages. The test suite instead
# runs from the repo root and imports this module as `backend.app.sdk`,
# where the only importable name is `backend.mystic_auth...`. Deriving the
# right prefix from __package__ (rather than hardcoding either spelling)
# keeps this file working unchanged in both contexts — and, importantly,
# resolves to the exact same module objects (the same `database`/`settings`/
# etc. singletons) the rest of whichever context is already running, rather
# than a second, separately-imported copy. That matters concretely:
# tests/backend/conftest.py imports `database` directly via
# `backend.mystic_auth.database.connection` and mutates `database.engine` on
# that object, expecting the app under test (imported here through
# `backend.app.main` -> `backend.app.sdk`) to see the same mutated instance.
