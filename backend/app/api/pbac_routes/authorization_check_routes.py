    Calculates a user's effective authorization for an action, using POST

    nested JSON, needed to evaluate ownership/resource-attribute/context
    conditions (e.g. "would this user be allowed to publish *this specific*
    draft document?"), not just a resource-type-level check.

    Runs the exact same decision logic the app itself would use for this
    user/action/resource/context (via AuthorizationService.authorize_detailed
    — no separate/duplicated evaluation logic), returning both the outcome
    and which policies were candidates vs. which actually granted it.

    This endpoint deliberately accepts check.context as caller-supplied —
    unlike every real protected route (which builds context itself via
    context/request_context_builder.py and never trusts a client-supplied
    value), this is a hypothetical "what would happen if" simulation tool
    for admins/operators, not a real access decision, so there is nothing
    to forge: no actual authorization outcome depends on it.

    Runs 1-50 authorization checks for the caller's own effective
    authorization in one request (see schemas/batch_authorization_schema.py
    for the exact bounds and per-field validation — malformed/oversized/
    empty batches are rejected by the schema itself, before this function
    runs). Requires only users:read_own, the baseline every real account
    holds via self_service: unlike the /users/{email}/authorization-check
    admin inspection tool (which checks *someone else's* access and needs
    policies:read), this endpoint always checks the caller's *own*
    effective authorization, so the bar is simply "you're a legitimate,
    onboarded account" rather than an elevated permission.

    Builds the real request context once and delegates the whole batch to
    AuthorizationService.authorize_batch, which fetches the caller's
    policies exactly once and reuses them for every check — avoiding
    repeated policy database queries within the batch — while calling the
    exact same PolicyEvaluationEngine used by every single authorize()
    call, so a batch-of-one check always agrees with calling authorize()
    directly for that same input. Each check is logged individually,
    exactly like a real authorize() call — this is a real decision, not a
    hypothetical "what if" simulation.

    The response exposes only `allowed` and a coarse `denial_reason` per
    check, deliberately never policy names or failed condition keys — those
    stay reserved for the admin inspection endpoint above.
