    Restores a policy to a prior recorded definition. The policy must still
    exist — restoring a deleted policy isn't supported here; recreate it via
    POST /policies instead. Every history entry resolves to a restorable
    definition, including "deleted" entries (their previous_definition is
    their pre-deletion state — see _definition_for_entry), so rolling back
    to a point before the policy was ever deleted is a valid target.

    The restored snapshot is applied via PolicyRepository.update, tagged as
    a "rolled_back" change so it's distinguishable from an ordinary edit —
    this creates a new history entry and never overwrites or removes the
    entry being rolled back to.

    Restoring a historical definition is otherwise indistinguishable from an
    ordinary edit in terms of what it can grant, so it goes through the same
    guards as PUT /policies/{policy_name}: a malformed conditions block is
    rejected, baseline policies can't be renamed/deactivated, and the caller
    must already hold every action the restored definition would grant —
    without this, rolling back to an old revision would be a way to silently
    re-grant a more powerful set of actions than update_policy would ever let
    the caller assign directly.
