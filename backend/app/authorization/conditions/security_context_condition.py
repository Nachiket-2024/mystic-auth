    Per claude.md: this app does not implement MFA/device-trust
    infrastructure itself — it only checks whatever fields a future trust-
    signal layer populates into that sub-key.

    Fails safe (denies) if context (or its security_context sub-key) is
    missing entirely, or any listed key is absent from it — an unset
    security signal must never be treated as satisfied by default.
