class PolicyEvaluationEngine:
    """
    The single place authorization decisions are actually computed. Pure
    and DB-free by design: it takes a user's already-fetched policies (the
    repository's job) and answers one question — "do any of these policies
    allow this action on this resource, given this context?" — without
    knowing how those policies were fetched or what a route is.

    This keeps the engine trivially unit-testable (no DB, no FastAPI, no
    mocking — just Policy objects in, bool out) and reusable from anywhere
    (routes via the authorization service/dependency, background jobs,
    management APIs computing "effective authorization" for inspection).

    Decision rule: default-deny; ALLOW if at least one active, applicable
    policy's conditions are satisfied. There is currently no explicit-deny
    policy concept (claude.md's spec describes Allow/Deny as the evaluation
    *outcome*, not necessarily two competing policy types) — every policy
    is a grant, and having zero applicable policies naturally means "deny".

    This engine only matches action/resource_type and then delegates a
    policy's whole `conditions` block to ConditionEvaluationService — it
    contains no condition-specific logic itself (see
    conditions/condition_handler.py): Authorization Engine -> Condition
    Evaluation Service -> Condition Handlers. Adding a new condition type
    (see conditions/) never requires touching this class.

        `policies` must already be filtered to the user's active, assigned
        policies (is_active=True) — this engine does not re-check that.
        `user_email` is used only for ownership-style conditions (e.g.
        "self_only"), never to look up a role. `resource` is the specific
        resource instance being acted on, if any, needed to evaluate
        ownership or resource-state conditions; `context` carries
        additional contextual information (e.g. request metadata) needed
        for "context_attributes" conditions (e.g. an MFA-gated action).

        Returns True if any policy whose resource_type + action matches has
        satisfied conditions, False (default-deny) otherwise — including
        when `policies` is empty.

        Thin wrapper over evaluate_detailed's `.allowed` — this is the fast
        path every real authorize() call goes through; evaluate_detailed's
        extra explainability bookkeeping (failed_conditions,
        denial_reason, ...) is cheap relative to a DB round trip, so there
        is one evaluation code path, not two, per claude.md's "Keep normal
        authorization fast" (satisfied) + "no duplicated permission logic".
