        context/request_context_builder.py — across every check, since they
        all describe the same single incoming request.

        Fetches the user's active, assigned policies exactly once and
        reuses that list for every check below, avoiding repeated policy
        database queries within one batch request. That's the only
        difference from calling authorize_with_decision N times (which

        identical PolicyEvaluationEngine.evaluate_detailed call
        authorize_detailed also makes, so a batch-of-one check always
        agrees with a single authorize() call for the same input. Each
        check's decision is logged individually, same as
        authorize_with_decision, just without re-fetching.
