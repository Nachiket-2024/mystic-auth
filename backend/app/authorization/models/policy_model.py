    A Policy is the primary authorization unit in this PBAC system. Users
    are authorized by the policies assigned to them (see UserPolicy below),
    never by their role — role is metadata only (display/reporting), per
    claude.md's "Roles" section.

    Fields map directly onto claude.md's required policy shape:
      - identity/description: name, description
      - allowed actions: actions (a list of action-identifier strings, e.g.
        "users:read_own" — the same vocabulary as authorization/permissions.py)
      - affected resources: resource_type ("users", or "*" for any resource)
      - conditions: conditions (JSON — e.g. {"self_only": true} for an
        ownership-scoped grant; see evaluators/policy_evaluator.py for how
        these are interpreted)
      - audit information: created_at/updated_at/created_by
      - inheritance/composition: deliberately NOT modeled as policy-to-policy
        references (e.g. "policy B extends policy A") — a user simply holds
        as many policies as they need (see UserPolicy), and the evaluator
        ORs across all of them. That achieves the same practical effect
        (broader access = more assigned policies) without a second
        composition mechanism to keep consistent with policy assignment.
