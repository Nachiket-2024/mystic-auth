def build_authorization_context(request: Request) -> dict:
    """
    Builds the `context` dict every real authorization check evaluates
    conditions against (see conditions/network_condition.py,
    conditions/time_condition.py, conditions/date_range_condition.py,
    conditions/security_context_condition.py for what reads each key).
    Centralized here so IP/time semantics are defined exactly once, per
    claude.md's "Every authorization check should use the same context
    builder" and "Do not trust client supplied values."

    `ip_address` is resolved via core/client_ip.py — the literal TCP peer
    (request.client.host) by default, or the real client behind
    X-Forwarded-For only if that peer is itself a configured trusted proxy
    (TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS). Never a header/query/body value trusted
    unconditionally, which a caller could set to whatever they like.

    `current_time` always comes from this backend's own clock (UTC, ISO
    8601) — never anything the caller supplies. The one documented
    exception is the authorization-check *inspection* endpoint
    (api/pbac_routes/authorization_check_routes.py's check_user_authorization), which
    deliberately accepts a caller-supplied hypothetical context to answer
    "what would happen if" — that endpoint never calls this builder, and
    never represents a real access decision.

    `security_context` starts empty: this app does not implement MFA/
    device-trust infrastructure yet (claude.md), so there is nothing
    trustworthy to populate it with. It exists as a stable, reserved key
    so a future trust-signal layer has exactly one place to feed its
    output into, without changing this function's callers.
