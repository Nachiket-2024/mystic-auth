    Resolves the real client IP for audit logging, rate limiting, and
    authorization context.

    request.client.host is the literal TCP peer — in a direct deployment (no
    reverse proxy) this is already the real client; behind a reverse proxy
    it's the proxy's own address instead. The X-Forwarded-For header is only
    trusted if that TCP peer is itself one of this deployment's configured
    reverse proxies (TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS) — otherwise any internet client could
    set X-Forwarded-For to whatever it likes and impersonate any IP. When
    trusted, the left-most entry is used: nginx's proxy_pass appends the real
    client to any X-Forwarded-For it received, so the first entry is the
    original client and any entries after it were appended by closer proxy
    hops.

    Returns None if request.client is unavailable (e.g. a test client with no
    real transport).
