    Runs signal_session_events_shutdown() the instant SIGTERM/SIGINT arrives,
    ahead of uvicorn's own handler.

    Why: uvicorn's shutdown waits for every open connection to close on its
    own before it calls our lifespan teardown, with no default timeout. A
    GET /auth/session-events stream never closes by itself, so signaling
    from inside lifespan teardown would never run - uvicorn would already be
    stuck waiting for that same connection forever. Chaining in front of
    uvicorn's handler here (installed at import time, before uvicorn
    registers its own) fires our shutdown signal first, then still calls
    uvicorn's original handler so its own shutdown sequence is unaffected.

    Only works on the main thread; signal.signal() raises off it, so we just
    skip installing the relay in that case.
