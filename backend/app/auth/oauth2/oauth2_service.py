        Authenticates an existing user or creates a new one from Google's verified

        Session/multi-device tracking is handled entirely inside
        jwt_service.create_refresh_token (the jti-based registry used by
        logout-all and reuse detection) — nothing further needs to be persisted

        held raw, cleartext bearer tokens in Redis on top of the canonical registry.

        Pre-hijacking note: an unverified account is not proof that whoever
        created it owns the email address — anyone can sign up with any email and
        just never click the verification link. If marking a pre-existing account
        verified here didn't also clear hashed_password, an attacker could
        pre-register the victim's email with a password of their choosing, leave
        it unverified, and silently inherit access the moment the real owner later
        signs in with Google: the account would become verified while the
        attacker's password remained valid, letting them log in as the victim
        indefinitely. Clearing hashed_password severs that password the instant
        Google proves the real owner's identity, so only the legitimate owner (via
        Google, or by setting a fresh password afterwards) can authenticate into
        the account from this point on. A previously *verified* account's password
        is never touched — that password was already proven to belong to this
        email's owner, so Google login there is a pure additional login method,
