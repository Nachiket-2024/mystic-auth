    Shared FastAPI dependency that authenticates the caller from their

    raises 401/403 via current_user_handler.

    Centralized here — rather than redefined per router — so every router
    authenticates through the exact same path, and so the authorization
    layer (authorization.permission_checker.require_permission) has a
    single canonical dependency to build permission checks on top of.
    Authentication (who is calling) and authorization (what they're allowed
    to do) are kept as separate concerns: this module only answers the
    former.
