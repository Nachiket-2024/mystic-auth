# Using This Repository as a Template

You've created your own repository from this template (via GitHub's **Use this template** button) to build your own product's authentication and authorization layer on top of it. This doc is a fast overview: what you get, how to run it, and where to make it yours. For how any specific piece actually works, see the rest of [`docs/`](../README.md).

---

## What this template provides

This template ships the authenticated app shell (sidebar, top bar, and the auth/PBAC/audit-log pages listed below) plus a minimal pre-auth landing page at `/` (`frontend/src/app/landing_page/LandingPage.tsx`, mounted in `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`) that redirects an already-signed-in visitor straight to `/dashboard`. It's a worked example of the "outside the auth shell" page shape, not a page meant to ship as-is - rename, restyle, or replace it freely (see [worked example §6](worked-example.md#6-a-pre-auth-landing-page)).

- **Authentication**: email+password with Argon2 hashing, email verification, rate limiting + brute-force lockout, Google OAuth2 (PKCE), JWT access+refresh tokens as httpOnly cookies, refresh-token rotation with reuse detection, logout/logout-all, forgot/reset password. See [Authentication Overview](../authentication/overview.md).
- **Authorization**: Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), not RBAC. Every protected route is gated by an assigned `Policy`, not by a user's `role`. Policies are data (rows in Postgres), so a new access rule is a new policy, not a new deploy. See [PBAC Architecture](../authorization/architecture.md).
- **Audit logging**: two append-only tables: security/session events, and every PBAC allow/deny decision. See [Database Design](../database/design.md#why-two-audit-tables-not-one).
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, Chakra UI v3, Zustand, TanStack Query. See [Frontend Architecture](../architecture/frontend.md).
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (dev + prod), PostgreSQL, Redis, Taskiq async email, Alembic migrations, GitHub Actions CI.
- **Error monitoring**: self-hosted Bugsink, on by default with the stack. See [Error Monitoring](../error-monitoring/overview.md).

## Quickstart

1. Click **[Use this template](https://github.com/Nachiket-2024/mystic-auth/generate)**, then clone *your* new repo.
2. `cp .env.example .env`: prefilled with working (fake) values, so this just works for local dev as-is. Only two things need real values before those specific features work: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` ([OAuth setup](#oauth-setup-google)) and `FROM_EMAIL`/`GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` ([Email setup](#email-setup)). Everything else runs fine without them.
3. Run the dev helper for your shell: `./scripts/docker/dev-up.sh` (Git Bash, WSL, Linux, macOS), `.\scripts\docker\dev-up.ps1` (PowerShell), or `scripts\docker\dev-up.cmd` (Command Prompt).

   The helper brings up backend, frontend, Postgres, Redis, Taskiq, and Bugsink, migrations included, then settles into showing just `backend`/`frontend`/`taskiq_worker`/`taskiq_scheduler` logs instead of every service's full startup output (see [Docker Overview](../docker/overview.md#day-to-day-dev-up-helpers)). Plain `docker compose up` still works if you want everything's logs interleaved instead.

Once it's up:

- **Backend docs**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Bugsink** (error monitoring): [http://localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010)
- **Taskiq** (email worker + retry scheduler): no UI or port, it just runs. The dev helper includes both `taskiq_worker` and `taskiq_scheduler` in the live log tail. Use `docker compose logs -f taskiq_worker` or `taskiq_scheduler` when you want only one of their logs. See [Background Email Delivery](../background-workers/taskiq.md).
- Postgres/Redis are reachable on `localhost:5433`/`localhost:6380` (non-default host ports, to avoid clashing with anything else you have running locally).

Then create the reserved system superuser (one-time, CLI-only):

```bash
docker compose exec -it backend python -m mystic_auth.scripts.create_system_user
```

See root [`README.md`](../../../README.md#-first-time-setup--creating-the-system-superuser) for the prompts.

---

## Environment configuration

Every setting is documented inline in [`.env.example`](../../../.env.example): treat that file as the source of truth, not this doc. `frontend/.env.example` only matters if you run the frontend locally with `npm run dev` instead of Docker.

To rename the app: set `APP_NAME` and `VITE_APP_NAME` in the root `.env`, then `docker compose up --build` (the frontend value is baked in at build time). Nothing else hardcodes a product name. CI keeps using its own placeholder `APP_NAME` regardless; that's expected, not something to sync.

---

## The `app/` + `mystic_auth/` split

Both backend and frontend are split into two trees, and every file in the repo falls into exactly one of three ownership tiers. This is purely a **file-path convention**: there's no tooling enforcing it (no `CODEOWNERS`, no merge driver), just a rule both this template and your own code agree to follow. Knowing which tier a file is in tells you whether you can edit it freely, should never edit it, or should expect the occasional merge conflict there.

| Tier | Files | Who edits it | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upstream-owned: never edit** | `backend/mystic_auth/`, `backend/app/sdk.py`, `frontend/src/mystic_auth/`, `frontend/src/app/sdk.ts`, `docs/mystic_auth/`, `screenshots/mystic_auth/` | Only upstream | This is the template's actual implementation. Since you never touch it, every `scripts/upstream-sync/sync-upstream.sh` merge applies here cleanly because there's nothing of yours for it to conflict with. |
| **Yours: upstream never touches it again** | `backend/app/app_sdk.py`, `frontend/src/app/app_sdk.ts`, `frontend/src/app/theme.ts`, `docs/app/`, `screenshots/app/`, root `README.md`, `SECURITY.md` | Only you | Upstream ships these once (`app_sdk.*`/`theme.ts` empty, the READMEs as generic starting points) and never edits them again in any future release. Since only you write to them, they never conflict either. |
| **Shared: extend in place, expect occasional conflicts** | `backend/app/main.py`, `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`, plus root-level config neither side owns outright: `frontend/package.json`, `backend/requirements.txt`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.local-prod.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `.env.example` | Both, over time | These have to ship as real, working files (an entry point that mounts routers, a router that renders routes, a dependency list, a compose file), so they can't start empty the way `app_sdk.*` does. You're expected to extend them (register your own router, add your own `<Route>`, add your own dependency), and upstream may also touch the same file later (e.g. a middleware-ordering fix, or a dependency swap). This is the one tier where a sync merge can genuinely conflict, and it's a normal, expected part of syncing when it happens. |

`sdk.py`/`sdk.ts` re-export the pieces you're meant to build on (`require_authorization`, `Permission`, `useAuthorization`, `ProtectedRoute`, the shared `api` client, and more): import from there, not from internal `mystic_auth/` paths directly.

Your own new feature folders (`backend/app/projects/`, `frontend/src/app/projects/`) are effectively a fourth, unlisted case: upstream has no idea they exist, so they behave like the "yours" tier automatically, with no path convention needed.

The diagram above only shows code files, since it's tracing import relationships; the shared config files from the table above (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `.env.example`) don't import anything, but they're in the same "Shared" tier as `main.py`/`App.tsx` for the same reason: you're expected to add your own entries, and upstream may add or change its own later. See [Syncing Upstream Template Updates](syncing-upstream.md) for what a conflict in one of these actually looks like.

---

## Frontend customization

- **Theme**: `frontend/src/app/theme.ts` (empty by default, like `app_sdk.ts`): set your own `brand` color scale here to re-skin the app. Merged on top of `mystic_auth/theme/system.ts`'s own config, so it never needs editing directly.
- **Pages**: `frontend/src/mystic_auth/` is organized one folder per feature (`auth/`, `dashboard/`, `manage_sessions/`, `account_settings/`, `users/`, `policies/`, `audit_log/`). See [Frontend Architecture](../architecture/frontend.md#module-layout).
- **Routing**: declared in `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`: add a `<Route>`, wrapped in `ProtectedRoute`.
- **State**: Zustand (`frontend/src/mystic_auth/store/`) for client state, TanStack Query for server state: both re-exported from `sdk.ts`.
- **Your own code** lives under `frontend/src/app/` (e.g. `frontend/src/app/projects/`), importing template pieces via `sdk.ts`/`app_sdk.ts`.

## Shared-chrome extension points

Some UI, like the sidebar, is rendered by mystic_auth/ but genuinely needs to reflect your own feature routes: "never edit mystic_auth/" can't mean "never add your own nav link." Rather than leaving that as a choice between hand-editing an upstream-owned file or having no nav link at all, the shared-chrome components that need this take an explicit prop for it:

| Component | Extension prop | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `AppLayout` (re-exported from `sdk.ts`) | `extraNavItems?: NavItem[]` | `NavItem` (also re-exported from `sdk.ts`): `{ label: string; to: string; permission?: string; order?: number; icon?: LucideIcon }` |
| `AppLayout` (re-exported from `sdk.ts`) | `extraNavbarContent?: React.ReactNode` | Any renderable node: the top bar's own built-ins (name, ThemeToggle, LogoutButton) are bespoke components rather than a uniform list, so this slot is free-form instead of a typed item array. |
| `CommandPalette` (re-exported from `sdk.ts`, mounted once in `App.tsx`) | `extraNavItems?: NavItem[]` | Same `NavItem`s you give `AppLayout` - pass the same reference so the palette's "Pages" results match the sidebar. |
| `CommandPalette` (re-exported from `sdk.ts`, mounted once in `App.tsx`) | `extraSearchItems?: SearchItem[]` | `SearchItem` (also re-exported from `sdk.ts`): a specific feature/section *within* one of your pages (not a whole page - that's what `extraNavItems` is for), surfaced by the palette's content search once the query is non-empty. |
| `AppLayout` (re-exported from `sdk.ts`) | `onOpenCommandPalette?: () => void` | Renders the clickable "search" button in the navbar (hidden below the `md` breakpoint) that opens the same `CommandPalette` instance. Cmd+K/Ctrl+K works without it (that shortcut is wired globally in `App.tsx`); omitting this prop just means there's no visible button for it, mouse-only users would have no way to open the palette. |
| `AuditLogPage` (imported directly in `App.tsx`, like any other page) | `extraResourceTypes?: string[]` | Appended after this app's own `AUTHORIZATION_RESOURCE_TYPES` in the "Authorization decisions" filter's resource dropdown. |
| `AuditLogPage` (imported directly in `App.tsx`, like any other page) | `extraActions?: string[]` | Appended after `PERMISSIONS`' own action strings in the same filter's action dropdown. |

Pass the same array to every `<AppLayout>` usage in your `App.tsx` (define it once, above your `<Routes>`, and reuse the reference) so the sidebar doesn't reshape as the user navigates between routes:

```tsx
import { AppLayout, type NavItem } from "./sdk";
import { APP_PERMISSIONS } from "./access/permissions"; // your own action vocabulary

const EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS: NavItem[] = [
    { label: "Projects", to: "/projects", permission: APP_PERMISSIONS.PROJECTS_READ },
];

// ...
<AppLayout extraNavItems={EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS}>
    <ProjectsPage />
</AppLayout>
```

Items with a `permission` are gated the same way the built-in nav items are (wrapped in `IfCan`), so a caller who lacks it simply doesn't see the link, the same as any built-in one. Omitting `extraNavItems` entirely renders the sidebar exactly as before this prop existed, so adopting it (or upgrading a project that predates it) is never a breaking change.

**Ordering.** By default your items render *after* every built-in one (Dashboard, Users, Policies, Audit Log, Account Settings), in the order you list them. That's what happens if you don't set `order` at all, so leaving it out is never a breaking change either. To interleave with the built-ins instead, give an item an `order` number: the built-ins are `10`/`20`/`30`/`40`/`50` (see `frontend/src/mystic_auth/layout/navItems.ts`), spaced out so you can slot in between any two without needing to know anyone else's exact value.

```tsx
const EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS: NavItem[] = [
    // Lands between Dashboard (10) and Users (20)
    { label: "Projects", to: "/projects", order: 15, permission: APP_PERMISSIONS.PROJECTS_READ },
];
```

Items sharing the same `order` (or all omitting it) keep their relative order from the array they were given in: ties never get shuffled.

**Top bar.** `extraNavbarContent` renders wherever you pass it, to the left of ThemeToggle/LogoutButton, no permission gating or ordering of its own since it's a single free-form slot rather than a list:

```tsx
import { AppLayout } from "./sdk";
import NotificationsBell from "./notifications/NotificationsBell";

// ...
<AppLayout extraNavItems={EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS} extraNavbarContent={<NotificationsBell />}>
    <ProjectsPage />
</AppLayout>
```

**Command palette (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K).** `CommandPalette` is mounted once at the app root in `App.tsx`, not inside `AppLayout`, so it takes its extension props there instead. Pass the same `onOpenCommandPalette` handler to every `<AppLayout>` so the navbar's search button opens this one instance:

```tsx
const [isPaletteOpen, setIsPaletteOpen] = useState(false);
const openCommandPalette = () => setIsPaletteOpen(true);

// ...
<AppLayout extraNavItems={EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS} onOpenCommandPalette={openCommandPalette}>
    <ProjectsPage />
</AppLayout>

<CommandPalette
    isOpen={isPaletteOpen}
    onClose={() => setIsPaletteOpen(false)}
    extraNavItems={EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS}
    extraSearchItems={EXTRA_SEARCH_ITEMS}
/>
```

`extraNavItems` is the exact same array you already pass to every `<AppLayout>` - reusing it keeps the palette's "Pages" results and the sidebar in sync automatically. `extraSearchItems` is for content search: a specific settings tab, a specific filtered view, anything a user might type a keyword for that isn't a whole page's own nav label. Each `SearchItem` is:

```ts
interface SearchItem {
    label: string;              // primary display text
    detail?: string;            // secondary text, e.g. distinguishes two items sharing a label
    group: string;              // the page/section this belongs to - shown as detail's fallback,
                                 // and folded into the search text (typing the page name matches too)
    matchKeys?: string[];       // extra strings folded into search text without being displayed
    to: string;                 // destination, e.g. "/projects?tab=billing" or "/projects#danger-zone"
    permission?: string;
    icon?: LucideIcon;
}
```

`label`/`detail`/`group`/`matchKeys` each accept either a plain string or an i18next `"namespace:key"` (resolved in the chrome language, same convention `NavItem.label` uses) - use translation keys if your app is localized, plain strings otherwise. A result's search text is `label + detail + group + matchKeys` joined, so you don't need to hand-maintain a separate keyword list in sync with whatever visible copy you're already reusing:

```tsx
import { CommandPalette, type SearchItem } from "./sdk";
import { CreditCard } from "lucide-react";

const EXTRA_SEARCH_ITEMS: SearchItem[] = [
    {
        label: "Billing",
        group: "Projects",
        matchKeys: ["Invoices", "Payment method"],
        to: "/projects?tab=billing",
        icon: CreditCard,
    },
];
```

For a `to` that points at a specific tab (`?tab=billing`) or a specific in-page section (`#danger-zone`), your page needs to actually read that on mount - see `AccountSettingsPage`/`AuditLogPage` for the query-param-driven-tab pattern (read once via `useSearchParams`, force a remount with `key={initialTab}` so a later deep-link while the page is already open still switches tabs), or `AppLayout`'s `useScrollToHash` for the `#hash` case (mounted once in `AppLayout` already, so any element with a matching `id` on any of your pages gets scrolled to automatically - just give it an `id`, no extra wiring needed). Omitting `extraSearchItems` entirely renders the palette exactly as before this prop existed.

**Audit log filters.** Unlike `AppLayout`, `AuditLogPage` isn't behind `sdk.ts`: it's a page component, imported directly in `App.tsx` the same way `DashboardPage`/`UsersPage`/`PoliciesPage` are, so you already edit that import site directly to add routes. If your app extends the PBAC resource-type or action vocabulary for its own domain (e.g. adding resource types beyond this app's own `users`/`policies`/`security_audit`), pass `extraResourceTypes`/`extraActions` so your own values show up in the "Authorization decisions" tab's filter dropdowns instead of only ever showing this app's built-in vocabulary:

```tsx
<AuditLogPage
    extraResourceTypes={["projects", "invoices"]}
    extraActions={["projects:read", "projects:write"]}
/>
```

Omitting either prop renders both dropdowns exactly as before these props existed.

If a future release adds an extension point to another shared component, it'll follow this same shape: a typed, optional, additive prop, listed in this table.

---

## Backend customization

- **New domain/resource**: a new top-level package under `backend/app/` (sibling to `mystic_auth/`) with its own model/schema/CRUD/router, mounted in `backend/app/main.py`, importing from `backend/app/sdk.py`. See [Backend Architecture](../architecture/backend.md#module-layout) for the shape to follow.
- **Database changes**: an Alembic migration under `backend/alembic/versions/`: no `create_all()`. See [Database Design](../database/design.md#migrations).
- **Configuration**: settings live in `backend/mystic_auth/core/settings.py`: add new ones there, re-exported from `sdk.py` as `settings`.

---

## PBAC usage

Protecting a route always goes through `require_authorization(action, resource_type)`: never a role check:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.sdk import require_authorization, Permission, database

router = APIRouter(prefix="/projects", tags=["Projects"])

@router.get("/")
async def list_all_projects(
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_authorization("projects:list_all", "projects")),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(database.get_session)
):
    return await project_crud.get_all(db)
```

`resource_type`/`action` don't need to be `Permission` enum values: any string works, granted via a policy (see [Writing and Testing Policies](../authorization/writing-testing-policies.md#policy-creation-workflow)). Only add a `Permission` enum member if the action is sensitive enough to need the privilege-escalation guard (see [Adding New Permissions](../authorization/adding-permissions.md)).

See [Worked Example: Adding a New Domain, End to End](worked-example.md) for all of the above: model, schema, router, migration, policy, frontend page, route, and nav link, wired together for one fake domain as a copy-and-rename starting point for your first feature.

Don't need PBAC's full generality (conditions, per-resource scoping), just "everyone with role X gets these actions"? See [RBAC Quickstart](../authorization/rbac-quickstart.md): same policies, just unconditioned ones, no separate mechanism to learn.

---

## Replacing the frontend entirely

The backend is a stateless JSON API with no frontend-specific coupling: deleting `frontend/` and building a different client against it is supported. It expects cookie-based JWT auth (`access_token` + `refresh_token`, both httpOnly/secure/`SameSite=Strict`) from an origin matching `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`. Full route contract: [API Reference](../api/reference.md).

---

## OAuth setup (Google)

1. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (Web application type).
2. Add an authorized redirect URI matching `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` exactly (scheme, host, path, trailing slash all matter).
3. Fill in `.env`: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/auth/oauth2/callback/google` locally).

See [OAuth2 / PKCE](../authentication/oauth2-pkce.md) for the mechanics and troubleshooting.

---

## Email setup

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FROM_EMAIL` | The Gmail account sending mail (also the SMTP username) |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | A Gmail [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (needs 2FA enabled) |
| `SUPPORT_EMAIL` | Optional `Reply-To`, falls back to `FROM_EMAIL` |

Without these, signup/verification/reset emails fail to send after retries, but the rest of the app keeps working. See [Background Email Delivery](../background-workers/taskiq.md).

---

## Deployment

See the [Deployment Guide](../deployment/guide.md) for Compose topology, required env vars, migrations, backups, and production host requirements. Use [`docker-compose.local-prod.yml`](../../../docker-compose.local-prod.yml) for a production-style local or self-hosted run behind an external TLS layer. Use [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](../../../docker-compose.prod.yml) for self-hosting on your own server, where Caddy terminates TLS.
