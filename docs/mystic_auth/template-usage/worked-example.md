# Worked Example: Adding a New Domain, End to End

[Using This Repository as a Template](overview.md) describes the pieces (ownership tiers, `sdk.py`/`sdk.ts`, PBAC usage, shared-chrome extension points) individually. This page wires them together for one fake domain (`projects`) so you have something to copy and rename rather than assemble from scratch. None of this is upstream code to run as-is — it's a template for the shape your own feature takes.

## 1. Backend: model, schema, router

```
backend/app/projects/
    __init__.py
    project_model.py     # SQLAlchemy model
    project_schema.py     # Pydantic request/response schemas
    project_crud.py       # DB queries
    project_routes.py     # APIRouter — this is the PBAC usage snippet below, in place
```

`project_routes.py`:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.sdk import require_authorization, database

router = APIRouter(prefix="/projects", tags=["Projects"])

@router.get("/")
async def list_all_projects(
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_authorization("projects:read", "projects")),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(database.get_session)
):
    return await project_crud.get_all(db)
```

`resource_type`/`action` don't need to be `Permission` enum values — any string works, granted via a policy (see [Writing and Testing Policies](../authorization/writing-testing-policies.md#policy-creation-workflow)). Only add a `Permission` enum member if the action is sensitive enough to need the privilege-escalation guard (see [Adding New Permissions](../authorization/adding-permissions.md)).

## 2. Mount it

```python
# backend/app/main.py — an existing "shared, extend in place" file, see overview.md's ownership table
from .projects.project_routes import router as projects_router
# ...
app.include_router(projects_router)
```

## 3. Add the migration

```bash
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "add projects table"
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

See [Database Design: migrations](../database/design.md#migrations) — no `create_all()`, ever.

## 4. Grant access via a policy, not a role

Nothing above grants anyone access by itself — `require_authorization` only checks whether the caller holds an active policy covering `("projects:read", "projects")`. Create one (via `/policies` in the UI, or the `POST /authorization/policies/` API) and assign it to whichever users/roles should see this data. See [Policy JSON Examples](../authorization/policy-examples.md) if you want a template to start from.

## 5. Frontend: page, route, nav link

```tsx
// frontend/src/app/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx
import { PageContainer, DataTable, type DataTableColumn } from "../app_sdk"; // your own re-exports, see app_sdk.ts
import { IfCan } from "../sdk";
import { APP_PERMISSIONS } from "../access/permissions"; // your own action vocabulary — see overview.md#shared-chrome-extension-points

const ProjectsPage: React.FC = () => {
    // fetch + render your projects here — see an existing mystic_auth/*
    // page for the query/table pattern this template already uses
    return <PageContainer title="Projects">{/* ... */}</PageContainer>;
};

export default ProjectsPage;
```

```tsx
// frontend/src/app/App.tsx — add the route
import { AppLayout, ProtectedRoute, type NavItem } from "./sdk";
const ProjectsPage = lazy(() => import("./projects/ProjectsPage"));

const EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS: NavItem[] = [
    { label: "Projects", to: "/projects", permission: APP_PERMISSIONS.PROJECTS_READ },
];

// inside <Routes>:
<Route path="/projects" element={
    <ProtectedRoute permission={APP_PERMISSIONS.PROJECTS_READ}>
        <AppLayout extraNavItems={EXTRA_NAV_ITEMS}>
            <ProjectsPage />
        </AppLayout>
    </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

That's the whole loop: a gated backend route, a migration for its table, a policy that actually grants access, and a frontend page that's both route-protected and only advertised in the sidebar to callers who can see it. Every other domain you add follows the same five steps.
