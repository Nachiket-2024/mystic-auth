# Security Decisions

A decision log capturing the *why* behind non-obvious security choices in this codebase, gathered in one place instead of scattered across code comments. Each entry links to where the actual implementation lives.

## `.dockerignore` previously let local files leak into built images

Two real, verified bugs found during a pre-release image-contents audit, both about files that exist on a developer's machine ending up baked into a Docker image that gets built and potentially shipped from that machine. Neither is something a template *consumer* needs to act on, since the fix is already in `.dockerignore`.

**Local access logs (`backend/logs/`) were baked into the backend image.** `backend/mystic_auth/logging/logging_config.py` creates this directory on import and writes real request data to it (paths, timestamps, correlation IDs) via a `TimedRotatingFileHandler`. `.dockerignore` had `*.log`, which only matches paths ending in exactly `.log`: the rotated sibling files that handler creates (`access.log.2026-07-19`, not `access.log.log`) don't match, and `backend.Dockerfile`'s `COPY backend/ .` copied them straight in. Verified concretely: a throwaway container built from the image (no bind mount) had 23MB of real local `backend/logs/*` content sitting in it. This isn't just wasted space: it's a snapshot of whoever's local dev traffic happened to be in that directory at build time, shipped inside a distributable artifact, and it made every image build non-reproducible (content depended on the builder's own local log history). Fixed by adding `backend/logs/` explicitly.

**`__pycache__/` and related patterns weren't actually excluding nested directories.** `.dockerignore` had bare `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pytest_cache/`, which look like they should match at any depth, but empirically didn't: a built image still contained `__pycache__/` directories nested under `backend/app/**/` and `backend/mystic_auth/**/` (bytecode caches that accumulate on the *host* filesystem because `docker-compose.yml`'s dev backend service bind-mounts `./backend:/app`, so Python running inside that container writes `.pyc` files straight back to the host, not into an isolated container layer). Verified by building the image both before and after the fix and listing its actual contents each time. Fixed by using explicit `**/`-prefixed recursive patterns (`**/__pycache__/`, `**/*.pyc`, `**/.pytest_cache/`) instead of relying on bare patterns to recurse on their own.

**Not affected**: the actual production frontend image (`docker/frontend.Dockerfile`'s `production` target), verified separately, since it only ever copies `--from=builder /app/dist` (the compiled static bundle) into the final `nginx` stage, never the intermediate `builder`/`dev` stages' full source tree where a stray `frontend/coverage/` (also newly excluded, though harmless content, not a leak) would have mattered.

CI now has a regression guard for the `backend/logs/` case specifically; see [CI/CD Overview](../cicd/overview.md). See `.dockerignore` for the full current exclusion list.

## Role is never used to decide access

PBAC (policy-based access control), not RBAC. `users.role` is nullable, display/grouping metadata only: every real authorization decision goes through an assigned, active `Policy` (see [../authorization/architecture.md](../authorization/architecture.md)). Two accounts with the identical role can have completely different effective permissions, and a roleless account (`role=NULL`) can still be fully authorized via policies alone.

**Why not RBAC**: a static role-permission mapping means every new access
pattern either overloads an existing role's meaning or requires a new role and a
code deploy. Policies are data, not code: a new access pattern is a new policy
row, assignable and revocable per account without touching role definitions.
The tradeoff is real: PBAC has more moving parts than `if role == admin`. The
`Permission` enum (`backend/mystic_auth/authorization/permissions.py`) still
gives the action vocabulary the same fixed-set discipline a role enum would.

**Where this is enforced structurally, not just by convention**: every admin route in `user_management_query_routes.py`, `user_management_update_routes.py`, and `user_lifecycle_routes.py` depends on `require_authorization(action, resource_type)`, never a role comparison. The handful of `role ==` checks that do exist (e.g. "the system account cannot be modified via these generic endpoints") are resource-protection invariants: they protect one specific reserved account from *every* caller regardless of what that caller is otherwise authorized to do, not authorization decisions. See the `UserRole` import comment at the top of each file for the exact reasoning, repeated at each guard site. The delete and purge routes additionally reject the caller acting on their own account, a self-lockout guard rather than an authorization decision.

## Why current-user lookups re-query the database every time

`current_user_handler.get_current_user` (called on every authenticated request) decodes the JWT *and* re-fetches the user row from Postgres, rather than trusting the token's claims alone. This is the mechanism that makes account deactivation/soft-delete take effect on the very next request, instead of only once the access token's own (up-to-one-hour) `exp` is reached. The cost is one extra DB round-trip per request; the alternative (trust the token until it expires) would mean a just-deleted or just-deactivated account could keep acting on the system for up to the full access-token lifetime.

---

## Email addresses are normalized, case-insensitively, everywhere

`User@Example.com` and `user@example.com` are the same account. Normalization (`emails/email_normalization.py::normalize_email`, strip + lowercase) happens at two layers, not scattered across every call site: `UserEmailCRUD.get_by_email`/`update_by_email` normalize on every lookup, and `UserBaseCRUD.create` normalizes before every insert. Together these cover every path (signup, login, OAuth2, admin routes) regardless of what casing the caller passes. `signup_schema.py`/`login_schema.py`/`password_reset_request_schema.py`/`UserBase` also normalize at the input boundary, so the canonical lowercase form flows through logs/tokens/audit from the earliest point, not just at the DB. `oauth2_service.py` normalizes explicitly right after reading `user_info.get("email")`, since that path is a raw dict from Google's response and never touches a Pydantic schema. The admin routes in `user_management_update_routes.py` and `user_lifecycle_routes.py` that take `user_email` as a path parameter normalize it before using it for lookups, session revocation, and audit logging, so a differently-cased path param still revokes the right sessions.

---

## Timing-attack mitigations

Applied consistently across every enumeration-sensitive endpoint:

- **Login** (`login_service.py`): the Argon2 password comparison always runs, against the real hash, or a fixed `DUMMY_HASH` if the account doesn't exist or has no password, *before* any existence/verification/active check. "Wrong password," "no such account," and "OAuth2-only account with no password" are all indistinguishable by response time.
- **Signup** (`signup_service.py`): the password is hashed unconditionally before the duplicate-email check, so a registered vs. unregistered email can't be distinguished by how fast the response comes back (only by the identical generic response body).
- **Password reset request**: always returns the same generic "if this email is registered..." message.

---

## Token replay and reuse detection

Refresh tokens are single-use. An atomic per-`jti` claim (`claim_jti_for_rotation`) marks one redeemed immediately after a successful rotation. If a token whose `jti` is already claimed is presented again, the cause could be a stale retry, a concurrent race, or token theft. The claim alone cannot distinguish those cases, so the response assumes the worst and bumps that token's own `chain_ver` (`revoke_chain_for_user`). That kills both the reused token and any rotated descendant sharing its chain, logged at `critical` severity. **This is deliberately scoped to the compromised chain, not every session on the account.** An earlier version bumped every session unconditionally, which meant a stale token replayed on any device could also kill an unrelated, never-compromised session created afterward. See [Session Management](../authentication/session-management.md#rotation-chains-and-reuse-detection) and [Authentication Overview](../authentication/overview.md#refresh-token-rotation).

A token minted before chain tracking existed carries no `chain` claim, so there's no lineage to scope to; reuse of one of those still falls back to the old, maximally-safe response (bumps `account_ver`, every session on the account).

**Version validity is checked *before* the reuse check, not just after.** A refresh token whose embedded `account_ver`/`chain_ver` has already fallen behind Redis's current value is rejected as stale before `claim_jti_for_rotation` runs. Without that order, a session that was intentionally ended could still rotate into a new valid session on its next refresh, since the single-use claim only catches a token redeemed twice.

**Rotation is atomic, closing a concurrent-request race.** Two requests presenting the identical still-valid refresh token at the same time must not both be able to rotate it. `JWTService.claim_jti_for_rotation` (`auth/token_logic/jwt_service.py`) uses a single atomic `SET revoked:{jti} true NX EX <ttl>`: Redis's `NX` flag makes the whole check-and-claim one operation, so only one of any concurrent pair can ever win. The loser is treated exactly like today's reuse case (`_handle_reuse_detected`, above), since a legitimate racing retry and a real replay attack are indistinguishable here anyway, so the same "assume the worst" response applies to both. Covered by `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/auth/token_logic/test_jti_revocation_unit.py` (the atomic claim itself) and `tests/backend/mystic_auth/integration/auth/test_refresh_token_integration.py::test_concurrent_refresh_with_the_same_token_only_one_succeeds` (two real concurrent requests against real Redis).

---

## Revocation is version-based: one Redis `INCR`, not a registry to iterate

Every access and refresh token embeds the account's `account_ver` and its own chain's `chain_ver` at mint time (`jwt_service.py`). `verify_token` and `refresh_tokens()` reject a token the instant either number falls behind Redis's current value. A whole-account revoke (`POST /auth/logout/all`, password reset confirm, self/admin password change, forced deactivation/purge) is a single `bump_account_version` call. One `INCR` makes every device's access and refresh tokens fail on their next use, with no per-token iteration. A single-session revoke (logout, a targeted Manage Sessions "End session", or chain-scoped reuse containment above) is the equivalent `bump_chain_version`, scoped to one chain.

This replaced an earlier design that tracked every live refresh-token `jti` in a per-user Redis Hash (to revoke by iterating it) plus a separate "access tokens issued before this timestamp are dead" epoch key for access tokens specifically. That epoch mechanism had a real, self-inflicted bug: PyJWT truncates a `datetime`-valued `iat` claim to whole seconds while encoding, but the epoch itself kept full sub-second precision, so a token minted the moment *after* a revoke (e.g. logging back in immediately after logout-all - trivially easy, since the two calls are naturally back-to-back) could still decode to an `iat` numerically *less* than the epoch, and come back rejected as if it predated a revocation it actually postdated. The fix at the time (encoding `iat` as a raw float instead of a `datetime`, preserving real ordering) is now moot: the version-based comparison this section describes is a plain integer equality check with no timestamp precision involved at all, so that whole class of bug can't recur. See `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/auth/token_logic/test_jwt_unit.py`.

## OAuth2 CSRF and account-hijacking protections

- **State + PKCE**: a random `state` (Redis + cookie, validated on callback, single-use via atomic `GETDEL`) plus PKCE (S256), exceeding the minimum CSRF protection a plain OAuth2 `state` parameter alone would provide.
- **`email_verified` is load-bearing**: an OAuth2 login is only trusted if Google's own `email_verified` flag is true. This is the *only* proof of address ownership the flow relies on.
- **Pre-registration hijack window**: if an attacker signs up with a victim's email (password-based, unverified) before the victim ever does, and the victim later authenticates via Google with that same address, the pre-existing account's password is cleared at that moment. Without this, the attacker's chosen password would remain valid on an account Google has now confirmed belongs to someone else. See [Google OAuth2 / PKCE](../authentication/oauth2-pkce.md) for the full walkthrough.
- **Redirect URI is server-side fixed**, never client-influenced, ruling out open-redirect-via-OAuth.

---

## The signup/OAuth2 email race

`user_crud.get_by_email` (existence check) and `user_crud.create` are not wrapped
in a single atomic transaction in either `signup_service.py` or
`oauth2_service.py`, so a TOCTOU race between two concurrent requests for the
same new email is theoretically possible at the application level. The database
closes it with a **unique constraint** on `users.email`, so the loser gets an
`IntegrityError`. Both call sites catch broad exceptions, log, and return a
clean failure (`False` or `None`) that the handler turns into the standard
generic error response.

---

## Self-service password change requires the current password

`PUT /users/me` (self-service profile update) requires `current_password`, verified against the account's existing `hashed_password`, whenever the request also sets a new `password`. Without this, a hijacked `access_token` cookie (e.g. via XSS) was enough to permanently lock the legitimate owner out: the attacker just sets a new password, no proof of the old one required, and the existing "password change revokes all sessions" behavior (see [../database/design.md](../database/design.md)) would then work *against* the real owner by killing their session too.

Skipped when the account has no password yet (`hashed_password is None`, an OAuth-only account setting a password for the first time): there's nothing to confirm against, and requiring one would make it impossible for such an account to ever add a password. The admin route (`PUT /users/{email}`, which reuses the same `UserUpdate` schema) does **not** require this, since an admin changing someone else's password already authenticated via their own `users:update_any` permission; requiring the *target's* current password there would be nonsensical (the admin doesn't have it) and isn't what the check is protecting against. See `backend/mystic_auth/api/user_routes/user_self_service_routes.py::update_my_profile` and `tests/backend/mystic_auth/integration/user_crud/test_user_self_service_routes_integration.py` (`test_self_password_change_requires_current_password`, `test_self_password_change_rejects_wrong_current_password`, `test_setting_a_first_password_on_an_oauth_only_account_does_not_require_current_password`) and `test_user_account_lifecycle_integration.py` (`test_admin_password_change_does_not_require_admins_current_password`).

---

## Logout and logout-all are idempotent about an already-dead refresh token

`POST /auth/logout` and `POST /auth/logout/all` previously treated "the presented refresh token is already revoked/expired/malformed" as an error (`400`), without clearing cookies. In practice this was reachable through a completely legitimate path, not just an attacker replaying a stale token: a self-service or admin password change (see below) revokes *every* refresh token for the account, including the one the current browser is still holding. So clicking Logout right after a "password updated" toast presented that now-dead token, got a `400 Invalid refresh token or already revoked`, and was left looking still logged in with stale cookies the client had no way to clear itself (`setupAuthInterceptor.ts` only acts on `401`, and `useLogoutMutation`'s `onSuccess`, the only place that clears the Zustand auth store, never fires on a mutation error).

Both handlers now treat this as a success instead: the caller's actual goal, no valid session left in this browser, is already true whether or not the presented token was still live to revoke, so both always clear cookies and return `200`. `logout/all` specifically switched from `jwt_service.verify_token` (which refuses to return anything for an already-revoked token) to `jwt_service.decode_payload` (which skips the revocation check, same as reuse-detection in `refresh_token_service.py`), so it can still resolve the owning email and revoke whatever sessions remain elsewhere, while still enforcing the token's `type` claim, so a wrong-type token (e.g. an access token mistakenly presented as the refresh cookie) is never treated as resolving a real session. The security audit trail is unaffected by the response-code change: both handlers still record `success=False` for an already-dead/undecodable token (and, for `logout/all`, `user_email=None` when no email could be recovered at all), so a real operator reviewing the log can still tell the two cases apart even though the caller-facing outcome looks identical.

Covers the admin-driven path too, not just self-service: an admin changing a *different* account's password (`PUT /users/{email}`) revokes that target's sessions, so the target's own browser, not the admin's, is the one left holding a dead refresh-token cookie; logging out from the target's session must succeed the same way. Also covers a malformed (not just merely-revoked) cookie value, and two logout calls presenting the identical already-used token back to back (e.g. two tabs, or a retried request): both must succeed rather than only the first. See `backend/mystic_auth/auth/logout/logout_handler.py`, `backend/mystic_auth/auth/logout_all/logout_all_handler.py`, `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/auth/logout/test_logout_handler_unit.py`, `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/auth/logout_all/test_logout_all_handler_unit.py`, and `tests/backend/mystic_auth/integration/user_crud/test_user_self_service_routes_integration.py` (`test_logout_after_self_password_change_still_succeeds_and_clears_cookies`, `test_logout_all_after_self_password_change_still_succeeds_and_clears_cookies`, `test_repeated_logout_calls_with_the_same_token_both_succeed`, `test_logout_with_malformed_refresh_token_cookie_still_succeeds_and_clears_cookies`, `test_logout_all_with_malformed_refresh_token_cookie_still_succeeds_and_clears_cookies`) and `test_user_account_lifecycle_integration.py` (`test_logout_after_admin_password_change_for_another_user_still_succeeds_and_clears_cookies`).

## `Settings` ignores env vars it doesn't declare, because `.env` is shared with Docker Compose

`backend/mystic_auth/core/settings.py`'s `Settings.Config` sets `extra = "ignore"`, overriding pydantic-settings' own default of `extra = "forbid"`. Reason: the root `.env` isn't exclusively this app's config file: Compose `env_file:` directives also hand the whole file to infra-only services that have no corresponding `Settings` field (`REDIS_PASSWORD` for `redis-server --requirepass`; `BUGSINK_*` for the optional self-hosted error-monitoring service, see [Error Monitoring](../error-monitoring/overview.md)).

With the default `"forbid"`, any such var crashed `Settings()` construction outright: but only sometimes, which made it a confusing bug to track down: `Settings.env_file = ".env"` is a *relative* path, so it only resolves to a real file (triggering pydantic-settings' own direct file parse, which builds a dict of literally every key in the file: not just ones it recognizes) when the process's working directory is the repo root. The running app (`WORKDIR /app` in the Docker image) never hits this, since a relative `.env` there resolves to nothing and pydantic-settings falls back to reading only its declared fields from `os.environ`. Running the test suite with `-w /repo` (required so tests can import `backend.app...`/`backend.mystic_auth...`, per [Testing Overview](../testing/overview.md)) does hit it, since `/repo/.env` genuinely exists there: so the exact same `.env` silently worked for the running app while crashing every test collection. `extra = "ignore"` makes both paths behave identically instead. See `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/core/test_settings_unit.py`.

**Known trade-off, accepted deliberately**: `"ignore"` also means a genuine typo in a variable this app *does* care about (`SENTRY_DSNN` instead of `SENTRY_DSN`, say) is silently dropped rather than raising a loud, easy-to-spot error: you'd only notice because the feature it configures quietly stays off, not because `Settings()` complained. `SECRET_KEY` and every other field this app treats as load-bearing are still fully validated on their own terms regardless (see `_secret_key_minimum_strength` below, and each field's required-vs-defaulted status in `Settings` itself): `extra = "ignore"` only affects keys the model was never going to look at anyway. Given `.env.example` documents every real field inline, this was judged the better trade against a shared `.env` file crashing the app outright over a var another service in the same compose stack legitimately needs.

---

## A malformed `SENTRY_DSN` must never crash the app

`error_monitoring/sentry_service.py::init_sentry()` runs unguarded at import time in `main.py`, before the app's own `global_exception_handler` exists to catch anything: it has to protect itself. `sentry_sdk.init()` raises (`sentry_sdk.utils.BadDsn`) on a malformed DSN string, verified directly: `sentry_sdk.init(dsn="not-a-valid-dsn-at-all", ...)` throws rather than degrading gracefully. Since `SENTRY_DSN` is meant to be a purely optional, best-effort setting (see [Error Monitoring](../error-monitoring/overview.md)), a typo in it must not be able to take down authentication for every user: so `init_sentry()` now wraps the `sentry_sdk.init()` call in a broad `try/except`, logs a clear warning (via `get_startup_logger()`, so it's visible directly in `docker compose logs` rather than buried in the routine-INFO-is-file-only log: see [Backend Architecture: logging](../architecture/backend.md#logging)), and returns with monitoring left off. The app itself starts regardless. See `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/error_monitoring/test_sentry_service_unit.py` (`test_init_sentry_does_not_raise_when_the_dsn_is_malformed`, `test_init_sentry_logs_a_warning_when_the_dsn_is_malformed`).

Also verified, separately: `capture_exception()` itself (called from the global exception handler on every request) is safe to call even when no Sentry client was ever successfully bound: `sentry_sdk`'s own public API is designed to never raise, by the SDK's own design principle that error-reporting code must never become a *worse* failure than the error it was reporting. Confirmed directly rather than assumed: calling `capture_exception()` with no `init_sentry()` ever having run produces no exception.

`JWTService.create_verification_token` previously hardcoded the JWT's own `exp` claim to `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (15min default) regardless of what its caller requested, while `account_verification_service.py` set the paired Redis single-use key's TTL: and the verification email's own wording: to `RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (60min default). A user clicking the link between 15 and 60 minutes in got a confusing invalid/expired error despite the email and the Redis key both saying it should still work. Fixed by threading `expires_minutes` through from the caller. Password-reset tokens (`password_service.create_reset_token`) were never affected: they build their own JWT directly with the caller's `expires_minutes`, a separate code path. See `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/auth/token_logic/test_jwt_unit.py` (`test_create_verification_token_honors_explicit_expires_minutes`) and `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/auth/verify_account/test_account_verification_service_unit.py` (`test_create_verification_token_forwards_expires_minutes_to_jwt_service`).

---

## Account lifecycle: soft delete by default

Deleting an account defaults to reversible (soft delete: `is_active=False` + `deleted_at` set, row and all FK-referencing audit/policy rows intact) rather than immediate permanent removal. Permanent removal (`purge`) is a separate endpoint gated by its own, more sensitive permission (`users:purge`, granted only by `system_superuser`): an admin who can delete accounts day-to-day cannot, by that permission alone, irreversibly destroy one. See [../database/design.md](../database/design.md#account-lifecycle) for the full mechanics, including why session invalidation is done explicitly (`revoke_all_tokens_for_user`) rather than relying on the refresh endpoint to notice on its own.

Self-service deletion (`DELETE /users/me`, `user_self_service_routes.py::delete_my_account`) reuses this same soft-delete path, never purge: the row is soft-deleted and sessions are revoked exactly like `delete_any_user` minus the path-parameterized target and the "not your own account" guard, which doesn't apply here since acting on your own account is the entire point. It writes a distinct audit event (`account_deleted_self`, vs. admin-initiated `account_deleted`) so the security audit log can tell the two apart at a glance. A soft-deleted account (self- or admin-initiated) is not held forever: a daily taskiq job (`taskiq_tasks/account_purge_tasks.py`, cron-scheduled via `LabelScheduleSource`) hard-purges any account whose `deleted_at` is older than `ACCOUNT_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS` (default 30), going through the exact same revoke → audit → delete sequence as a manual purge (`user_lifecycle/user_purge_service.py::purge_user_account`, shared by both call sites) so the grace-period purge and an admin's manual purge can never drift apart. This is what gives self-service deletion an actual recovery window instead of either purging synchronously (no recovery at all) or never purging (an unbounded pile of soft-deleted rows).

Both the soft-delete step and the actual re-authentication proving intent differ by account type, though, and deliberately so:

- **An account with a password** re-authenticates and is deleted synchronously, in the same request: the caller supplies their current password (the same `password_service.verify_password` call the self-service password-change flow uses), and on success `delete_my_account` runs the soft-delete → revoke-sessions → audit sequence immediately, then clears the `access_token`/`refresh_token` cookies on its `Response` before returning (the same cookie shape `logout_handler.py` uses, including `refresh_token`'s `path="/auth"`): a gap the endpoint had before this cookie-clearing was added, unlike every other session-ending endpoint.
- **An OAuth-only account** (`hashed_password is None`) has no password to re-confirm with, so an active session cookie alone would otherwise be sufficient proof: a stolen access-token cookie (e.g. via XSS) could delete the account outright with nothing else required. Rather than skip re-authentication for this case, `account_deletion_service.py` gives it an async, email-confirmed equivalent, modeled directly on `auth/password_logic/password_reset_service.py`: a signed JWT (`type` claim `"account_delete"`, scoping it away from access/refresh/reset tokens sharing the same `SECRET_KEY`) is minted, persisted in Redis under `account_delete:{token}` with a TTL from `ACCOUNT_DELETE_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (default 60), and emailed as a link to the frontend's `/confirm-delete` page. `delete_my_account` returns immediately in this branch without deleting anything: the account and the calling session stay untouched until the link is used. `POST /users/me/confirm-delete` (deliberately unauthenticated, same trust model as `POST /auth/password-reset/confirm`: the token itself is the proof, and the link must work from whatever device the caller opened their email on) redeems the token via Redis `GETDEL` (atomic single-use, for the same replay-race reason `password_reset_service.reset_password`'s doc-comment explains), then runs the exact same soft-delete → revoke-sessions → audit sequence as the password-account path. Both paths call one shared function (`user_lifecycle/user_self_deletion_service.py::finalize_self_deletion`) so they can't drift apart, mirroring `purge_user_account`'s share between the admin purge route and the scheduled grace-period job. The confirm endpoint also gets its own login-lockout-style rate limiting via `login_protection_service.check_and_record_action`, under a `account_delete_confirm_lock:email:` namespace distinct from both `login_lock:email:` and `password_reset_confirm_lock:email:`, for the same reason those two stay distinct from each other: a stale or reused deletion link must never count towards, or be able to trip, an unrelated lockout for that email.

---

## Rate limiting and lockout are layered, not singular

Login has **both** a generic sliding-window rate limiter (per-IP and per-account) and a separate, purpose-built brute-force lockout service with its own thresholds (`MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` / `MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_PER_IP`). The two serve different purposes: the rate limiter caps *request volume* generically (applied to all 10 routes in `auth_routes.py`: signup, login, OAuth2 login/callback, `/auth/me`, logout, logout-all, password-reset request/confirm, verify-account); the lockout service specifically tracks *failed authentication attempts* and can lock an account/IP out even if each individual request was well within the rate limit. `POST /auth/refresh/` is deliberately **not** rate-limited by this mechanism: the refresh flow already has its own protection via single-use token rotation and reuse detection (see above), which a generic request-volume limiter would only duplicate. See [Login](../authentication/login.md).

### Rate limiter fails closed on a Redis outage: reviewed, kept intentionally

`RateLimiterService.record_request` (`auth/security/rate_limiter_service.py`) catches every Redis exception and returns `False` ("not allowed"). Because all 10 rate-limited routes depend on this, a Redis outage makes every one of them return `429` for everyone: a full, if temporary, authentication-surface outage, not just degraded rate limiting.

**This was reviewed and kept as-is, deliberately.** The alternative: fail *open* (treat a Redis outage as "unlimited," letting every request through unthrottled): would silently disable brute-force and credential-stuffing protection across the entire authentication surface at precisely the moment (infrastructure instability) an attacker is statistically most likely to be probing for exactly that kind of gap. A temporary full-surface `429` is recoverable and visible (users see errors, monitoring/alerting on 429 rates would catch it); a temporary silent removal of all rate limiting is neither. For a template whose purpose is an authentication *foundation*, fail-closed is the safer default to ship.

This is a genuine availability/security tradeoff, not a free resolution either way: a deployment with different priorities (e.g. one that treats any auth downtime as worse than degraded brute-force protection, because Redis outages are rare and monitored separately) can override it by changing `record_request`'s `except` clause to return `True` instead. That should be a deliberate, reviewed change for that specific deployment, not this template's default.

## Background task queue: Taskiq vs Celery

The app is fully async (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy async, `asyncio` throughout), and [Taskiq](https://taskiq-python.github.io/) was chosen over [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/) for the one background job this template has today (sending email: see [../background-workers/taskiq.md](../background-workers/taskiq.md)).

**Why an async application changes the calculus at all**: Celery's worker model predates `asyncio` and is fundamentally synchronous/thread-or-process-based. Running truly async task code under Celery means either wrapping every async call in `asyncio.run(...)` per task (defeats the point: you get a new event loop per task, no shared connection pooling across tasks in a worker process) or reaching for `gevent`/`eventlet` monkey-patching to fake concurrency, which has its own long history of subtle incompatibilities with async libraries (`asyncpg`, `redis.asyncio`, `aiosmtplib`: all already in use here) that patch at the socket/greenlet level instead of participating in the same event loop. Taskiq's broker/worker are `async def` from the ground up, so `send_email_task` is a plain coroutine that shares the same `asyncio` primitives (and, in principle, the same connection pools) as the rest of the app: no bridging layer.

**Celery's real strengths, stated fairly**: this is not a "Celery is bad" argument:
- **Maturity and ecosystem**: over a decade of production use, extensive documentation, first-class support in most PaaS/deployment guides, mature monitoring (Flower), broker flexibility (RabbitMQ, SQS, Redis, and more), and a huge base of Stack Overflow/blog troubleshooting content that a niche library like Taskiq simply doesn't have yet.
- **Feature depth**: complex workflows (chains, chords, groups), rate limiting per task, more granular retry/backoff policies out of the box, and a battle-tested scheduler (`celery beat`).
- For a team already running a synchronous (WSGI) stack, or with existing Celery operational expertise, Celery remains the safer default: there's no async-compatibility problem to solve if nothing else in the stack is async either.

**Why this project chose Taskiq anyway**: the whole backend is already async end-to-end, and Redis is already a hard dependency for rate-limiting, login-lockout state, and refresh-token `jti` tracking: so a Redis-backed Taskiq broker (`RedisStreamBroker`) adds zero new infrastructure. Celery would either need its own broker (typically RabbitMQ, adding a service) or reuse Redis in a less idiomatic way (Celery-over-Redis is supported but is the less-travelled path in Celery's own ecosystem, with known limitations around visibility/ack timeouts). Given the task volume here is one job (email sending), Taskiq's smaller feature set is not a real cost: the deciding factor was avoiding a sync/async impedance mismatch and avoiding a second piece of broker infrastructure, not a claim that Taskiq is categorically better.

## Why MFA is not enabled

No multi-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS, WebAuthn, or otherwise) is implemented: this is an intentionally deferred scope boundary for a template repository, not an oversight discovered late:

- `authorization/conditions/condition_types/security_context_condition.py` and `authorization/context/request_context_builder.py` both carry explicit comments that `security_context` starts empty because this app does not implement MFA/device-trust infrastructure; any policy condition keyed on it (e.g. a hypothetical `mfa_verified` check) would currently always evaluate to false/deny.
- The PBAC condition framework (`context_attributes`, `security_context` condition types: see [../authorization/condition-schema-reference.md](../authorization/condition-schema-reference.md)) was deliberately built generic enough that a real MFA layer could plug in later by populating `security_context` at authentication time and writing policies that key off it: without any redesign of the authorization engine itself. The `mfa_verified` key appears in tests and docs today purely as an illustrative example of the generic mechanism, not a real, enforced check.
- **Why not build it now**: MFA enrollment/verification is a substantial feature on its own (secret storage, recovery codes, rate-limiting the verification step itself, UI for enrollment/challenge) that would roughly double the scope of the authentication surface for a template whose goal is a solid PBAC/session foundation, not a complete IdP feature set. Adding a half-built MFA flow (e.g. TOTP storage with no recovery-code UX) would be worse than not having it: a template should not ship a security feature that looks complete but isn't.
- Any real deployment that needs MFA should treat it as a deliberate follow-up: add a TOTP/WebAuthn enrollment+verification flow, populate `security_context.mfa_verified` on successful step-up auth, and gate sensitive policies on that context key: the hooks already exist to receive it.

## Intentionally deferred features

Recorded in one place rather than scattered across code comments: each of these was a deliberate scope decision for this template, not something missed:

- **MFA / device trust**: see above.
- **Per-endpoint rate-limit overrides**: one global `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW`/`REQUEST_WINDOW_SECONDS` applies to every rate-limited route; the login-specific brute-force lockout layers a second, endpoint-specific control on top of the highest-risk route instead. See [Concerns](../concerns/README.md).
- **Email provider swapping beyond SMTP**: `emails/email_sender.py` now isolates the transport behind an `EmailSender` protocol, but only one implementation (`SMTPEmailSender`) exists; adding SES/SendGrid/Postmark support is a new class, not a framework change, and is left for whoever needs a specific provider.
- **Deploy automation**: CI verifies both Dockerfiles build but never pushes to a registry or deploys anywhere; this template assumes no specific production host (see [Deployment Guide](../deployment/guide.md#production-host-requirements)).

## Known accepted gaps / follow-ups

Recorded here rather than silently left unaddressed, so it's a deliberate backlog, not an oversight. (Forwarded-header trust, Redis authentication, and `SECRET_KEY` strength enforcement were also tracked here previously: all three are resolved and documented in [Security Hardening](hardening.md) now, rather than lingering here as crossed-out history.)

- **No automated database backups**: `scripts/db/db_backup.sh`/`scripts/db/db_restore.sh` now script the `pg_dump`/`psql` runbook (see [Deployment Guide](../deployment/guide.md#backups)), but there's still no *scheduler* wired up anywhere in this repo, since no specific production host/cloud target is assumed to hang a cron job on.
